uC6ItxSCwx0,absoluteDogs,Handling Rough Play The Right Way With Your Dog,"In this week‚Äôs AbsoluteDogs TV Episode, we discuss:

Does your dog play roughly with other dogs and what can you do to encourage your dog in the play the right way?

If you find yourself saying, ‚ÄúOh, he needs to be corrected,‚Äù to another dog‚Äôs owner when your dog is being inappropriate, this may be just the episode for you!

Dogs don‚Äôt always come wired to have the most appropriate communication skills with other dogs. These skills or natural inclinations can be shaped by the environment, by other dogs they‚Äôre exposed to, as well as simply their natural energy and commitment to the party to be had!

Most of the time a dog that is over the top about playing with other dogs can appear confident and yet, actually, they‚Äôre lacking confidence in the interaction which is why they‚Äôre being inappropriate.

Nifty, a young, rough playing Border Collie demonstrates her desire for FLAIR, while we talk you through our top tips. Working on a specific ‚Äúproblem‚Äù (i.e. rough housing) doesn‚Äôt always require putting your dog in the situation so that they could possibly fail‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre going to find light bulbs galore in this episode.

Whether it's sheep (that's Nifty's preference), squirrels, other critters, cars, or even people and dogs outside of your window, it can be so hard to know the path forward. Don't you worry.

Does your dog like to hunt real and imaginary critters? 

In today‚Äôs AbsoluteDogsTV episode, we‚Äôre covering our top tips for combatting your dog‚Äôs ‚Äúhunt‚Äù struggles. Some dogs are more prone to wanting to hunt than others given their genetic makeup and the behaviours they‚Äôve rehearsed throughout their lives. 

Did you know that, even for a dog bred to hunt, you can channel that behaviour in a different (much healthier) way so that your dog is meeting their biological needs and yet also not rehearsing undesirable behaviours that are really frustrating when you‚Äôd prefer focus, engagement and value in YOU. 

Put a training plan in place and plan your next three weeks! Your dog will become what they rehearse. Being mindful of allowing them access to the opportunities when your dog doesn‚Äôt have the skillset to make the right choice can make training progress much slower. Speed up your success with the top tips we share in today‚Äôs episode!

We know, without a doubt, that he will continue to inspire the world through the power of games, as Jasper X, the NBN dog that gave so many dog owners in so many countries hope that their dog could be their very best version of themselves, too, just like Jasper.",,2022-06-19T09:00:56Z,PT33M8S,hd,false,382,11,0,3

Q2SEOamP_Os,absoluteDogs,THE solution to stopping your dog pulling on lead,"In this week‚Äôs AbsoluteDogs TV Episode, we discuss:

Does your dog pull on lead? We are here to tell you the top TWO skills that your dog will need in order to relieve that tension on the lead and give you a dog that walks politely, in every environment! 

What is skill #1?
Your dog needs to know that they should be paying attention to you from the very start. Whether your dog has a history of rehearsing ignoring you on every walk or they check out when distractions are more tempting, but are great when distractions aren‚Äôt around, this is a skill they absolutely need. Choosing you is #1 and Orientation Game will get you there! 

What is skill #2?
Your dog needs to know WHERE they need to be! Believe it or not, telling them verbally or via the leash isn‚Äôt clear communication. Instead, top up the value in your proximity to make the best deal for them the most obvious one. We show you a fun, easy, effective game focusing on proximity.

We demonstrate the games and more within this epic pulling on lead episode this week on our AbsoluteDogsTV channel. In fact, not only do we demonstrate games and strategies that will move you closer to your dog-owning dream, we also have created a challenge that will absolutely transform your walks!

Setting your dog up for success can encourage the right behaviour choices in the situation vs. waiting for failure to address it.

Navigating dog-people interactions can be tricky. Rehearsal in advance, awareness that advocating for your dog can be uncomfortable and necessary, as well as identifying when a situation may not be ideal are all incredibly important to setting your dog up for success.

Using food is one of the many ways you can reward your dog when you play games! We like to use our dog's daily food allowance as rewards by ditching the food bowl to start building our relationship and training journey.

When working with a puppy or young dog, we need to consider a few things to ensure that we are utilising their food in a way they can make sense of it.  For example, considering how well developed our puppy or young dogs' eye sight is before attempting to teach them how to catch or how far to bowl a piece of food out for them will help us set the training session up for success.

Dive into this action packed episode for more tips and tricks for using your dogs' daily food allowance as rewards!

ffAzsg-AyYo,absoluteDogs,How To Train Your Poodle,"In this week‚Äôs AbsoluteDogs TV Episode, we discuss:

Do you own a poodle or poodle cross?

We‚Äôve worked with many, many poodles and mixed breeds that sometimes express their poodle ancestry in various ways.

It can be valuable to consider how your dog‚Äôs genetic makeup is influencing their choices and behaviour.

In this episode, we unlock some super strategies, that while valuable for most dogs, are inspired by our experience with poodles.

Did you know that poodles have been bred to perform water retrieves, Gundog jobs, and more! This history can explain why your Poodle is making certain choices because even though your Poodle may not be trained to retrieve in the field, they may innately make choices based on that history. Poodles are quite intelligent. They're not a fan of repetition and they can be motivated quite differently from a herding breed.

bsADoXQRGgE,absoluteDogs,STAS: Introducing Dogs To One Another,"How can you introduce dogs to each other?

In today's podcast episode, we are diving into safely introducing dogs and the considerations you can have in mind as you work toward introducing a new dog into your home or dogs that may be spending time together. 

How can your emotions and behaviour have an impact
What can you do if you feel you aren't confident in orchestrating the introduction
Identifying whether your dog is ready or prepared for an introduction
Setting the scene to maintain safety and allow freedom of communication

Making sure you have considered the set up and the process of preparing them for the interaction gradually. We provide examples (including with other animals!). 

There are so many situations where knowing the best approach is essential to the success of the introduction. There is no rush and be sure to have safe guards in place that ensure the introduction happens in the way you want it to vs. a spontaneous interaction that occurs due to a failure of set up, such as a barrier breakdown, etc. 

Introducing your new puppy to an adult or senior dog, into a multi-animal and multi-dog household, as well as introducing a new rescue or rehome into your home can go smoothly when you're able to set the energy, set the expectations, and minimise the opportunity for poor decisions. 

Every situation will flex dependent on the variables and some dogs will require much slower introductions than others. Listen in for our top tips to introducing dogs and let us know what you think!",,2022-02-13T10:00:16Z,PT17M8S,hd,false,717,19,0,2

Setting really clear expectations is important with family members to set your dog up for success (and you!). Let‚Äôs face it, it can be really frustrating when everyone has their own opinions and thoughts on how training should happen and what is acceptable and what isn‚Äôt acceptable.¬†

Shaping them into interacting with your dog in the best way¬†

How do you reward your dog? Is your dog‚Äôs experience with reinforcement very predictable?

Good reinforcement strategies are:

¬∑ Generous

¬∑ Variable

¬∑ Unpredictable

You are the party-bringer, the joy finder, the person that is going to light your dog up with the rewards you use ‚Äì and that includes HOW those rewards are delivered.

Some dogs struggle switching from one type of reward (food) to another type of reward (toys, for example). This is an important life skill, to transition between the different reinforcers because life is throwing reinforcement all of the time.

You can be the ultimate reward for your dog by teaching them to transition from one reward value to another and this video is going to get you started!

The recall struggle is real! Dogs are creative and really amazing at discovering patterns in the day-to-day. Things like:

‚Ä¢  Clipping the lead on at the end of the walk meaning the fun is over

Many of us have experienced this struggle and part of being an a flexible, resourceful Gamechanger is embracing the games-based approach with games that truly speak to the motivations behind your dog‚Äôs behaviour. 

In today‚Äôs episode, we dive into some really impactful games and strategies that will help you come out on the other side of this struggle with real-life results AND a dog that suddenly gets excited when the leash comes out anywhere and everywhere.

Does your dog have a hard time when they have something valuable, such as a bone? There is always a game for that! Today we talk on how you can get your dog to move away from something delicious without any conflict whatsoever! 

What does that mean? That means NO GROWLY behaviour!

There is no need to take things from your dog, especially if that‚Äôs been part of your dog‚Äôs relationship with bones in the past. If they think it will get taken away, they are more likely to show that growly behaviour we don‚Äôt want to see. 

Watch this episode as we talk you through a more cooperative, and safe, way to handle these situations where you need your dog to come away from a bone. 

Observe three dogs, ALL at the same time, enjoy some meaty, yummy bones and get to see just how you can create a safer relationship-enhancing approach through games-based training.

Xf6Eco1f3Sg,absoluteDogs,STAS: Imposter Syndrome,"This week we discuss: Imposter Syndrome

No matter whether you are a dog owner, aspiring dog trainer, or a professional dog trainer, this very much applies to you. 

What is imposter syndrome? This is when, in any facet of your life, you doubt your skills, talents, or accomplishments.

J7A8KSV-_Uc,absoluteDogs,Top Tips For A Stress Free Walk Part 2!,"In this week‚Äôs video, we cover: Top Tips for A Stress-Free Walk Part 2

This is a multi-part series! This is Part 2!

Are you ready for training exercises and games that will help your dog truly earn and enjoy off leash freedom?

In today‚Äôs video we explore the Double Clip Game. Being off lead shouldn‚Äôt be a huge event for your dog. You don‚Äôt want your dog to bolt off as soon as you clip your dog off leash. 

We discuss fading food reinforcement based on where your dog is at in their journey. There are different stages and knowing how you can support your dog best in their journey is so, so key. 

Predictability can lead to frustration and over excitement. Changing it up, making certain parts of the walk on lead vs. off lead, playing the games that target proximity, and more can help you achieve off leash freedom. 

Magma and Abra demonstrate off leash freedom with one dog, as well as two dogs. What can you do to get real-life results and stress-free walks (on or off leash)?

 Check out the link below for the Sexier than a Squirrel Challenge where stress-free walks are within your reach through the power of games.

As our dogs age, their bodies change, as do their minds. In this episode, we want to empower dog owners around the world to take charge of their senior dog‚Äôs care and to take action in reducing (and sometimes even reversing) the symptoms of ageing. 

We have experienced ageing dogs in our own homes, and we are all too aware of the changes that can occur. Our once spry, joyful, and alert dogs can become a little stiffer, sleep more, wake more at odd hours, or even appear to be less joyful in their interactions with us. 

Our own senior dogs inspired us to grow our knowledge. What can you do to support your senior dog? We dive deeper into cognitive changes, as well as physical changes, and include some great learning, as well as some implementable strategies so that you too can help support your dog as they enter their senior years. 

Not only are there a lot of things you can do day to day that will help your dog; there are also some great ways to support your senior dog nutritionally. Empower yourself and other senior dog owners by listening in and sharing this immense episode with any owners you know may benefit.

This is a multi-part series! This is Part 1!

When your dog pulls on lead, chases critters, sniffs anything and everything, it can be frustrating. One of the larger questions we can get asked with this very common struggle is: How do I even get started?

We are covering some top tips on how to STOP bad behaviour on your walks with some easy, implementable strategies that will help you and your dog achieve less stressful walks. 

Before you even start your walk, what do you want your walk to look like?

Some top tips include more coaching on:

‚Ä¢ Starting as you mean to go on
‚Ä¢ Avoiding nagging your dog!
‚Ä¢ Equipping yourself and your dog appropriately for their level of training
‚Ä¢ What kind of energy should you have on your walk?
‚Ä¢ What should you be aware of when you are on your walk?
‚Ä¢ How do you respond to sudden changes in the environment?
‚Ä¢ Reinforcement strategies aren‚Äôt always the same for every dog! 
‚Ä¢ Train the dog in front of you!
‚Ä¢ What does your dog love? Make your walk bespoke to you and your dog.
‚Ä¢ Deciding the purpose of your walk before you even start.

Training starts with looking at the dog in front of you and we explore this in today‚Äôs video. It‚Äôs all going to make sense once you dive in. Look out for Part 2 where we dive into off lead freedom!

What can be stopped? Urinating in the house and howling when left alone‚Ä¶ 

Tom, a veterinary behaviourist, and top dog trainer is talking on neutering to prevent or stop problem behaviours in dogs in this jampacked episode of AbsoluteDogsTV.

This is NOT about population control, but instead this is about responsible dog owners like you that have been advised to neuter your dog and you‚Äôre not sure if it‚Äôs the right thing to do. 

So much information is out there, and this is an important video to share. Even if you have neutered your dog, it‚Äôs not too late! There are some exercises (super fun games!) you can play to combat the neuter.

What can you, as an empowered dog owner, do to make the most informed decision for your dog?

Justin inspires and motivates others to become their own superhero. Even if you‚Äôre doing something that wasn‚Äôt exactly your dream, and your passion lies elsewhere, your answers await you within this episode.

When we encounter failure and show our dog it‚Äôs an adverse outcome, we can trigger in them frustration, loss of motivation, and grit, leading to pessimism and other negative emotions. A once optimistic dog can quickly become a pessimistic one when failure is all they know. 

When we use the Gamechanger method, we can prevent our dogs from believing that failure is terrible by rewarding the outcome regardless of whether they‚Äôve got it spot on or not. This goes against what we‚Äôre taught by rewards-based dog trainers who would have us do differently.

Jaakko Suoknuuti is an accomplished Agility Handler & Coach who is widely respected in the Sport of Agility. ¬†He & his partner Janita Leinonen are the creators of the popular handling methodology OneMind Dogs. ¬†They've both been a part of Team Finland for many years and earned many world championship titles. ¬†¬†

Jaakko and Kayl met back in 2012 and became fast friends. ¬†Kayl spent many years traveling to Finland to train and Jaakko would travel to Canada to coach the McCann Dogs Agility group. ¬†¬†Jaakko has the unique ability to see an Agility course from the dogs perspective which gives him the ability to teach, handle, design courses and coach students at a whole new level. ¬†¬†

In Part 1 of this 2 part podcast, We discuss with Jaakko, the many facets of becoming a better handler for our dogs by understanding what our DOG needs from us as we navigate a course. ¬†We're going to share with you the concept of ¬†""CCC"" - Connect, Commit & Cue which are the 3 steps that have to happen between every obstacle on course!¬†

I‚Äôm taking this time to continue building excellent independent skills & verbal cues.  

I was so happy with how we did this week!  Here‚Äôs a highlight of our training sessions this week. 

This is NOT what it looked like on the first try.  I definitely had to break some of the exercises down and train through them.  

If you want to know HOW this is trained, check out my patreon page to join my Online Coaching Club.   On this platform I focus on teaching my patreon how to develop excellent skills, independence and to improve you‚Äôre overall teamwork with your dog.    In the lessons I include the good & the bad so you can see exactly how I train through challenges.  

This platform is suited for team‚Äôs that have some experience with Agility already.   Minimal space & equipment is needed but there are 100s of lesson plans to choose from that will suit your needs.

Bee-Line and I trained on this Standard Course from Austrian Judge, Wolfgang Tieber.  This course was from the France Team Tryouts in 2018.  It was a fun one, but I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the DW approach.  I chose to set her up as best I could but had to sacrifice my position at the end of the dog walk.  OH, the joys of a running dog walk. Lol.   That jump at the end was actually super sneaky.  The dogs naturally want to come off to the right and miss the jump.  Thank god for verbals!!! 

Bee was happy to play agility but was NOT impressed with wearing undies.  Poor dog, I could have choose less obvious ones.",,2020-06-19T15:15:03Z,PT35S,sd,false,920,28,0,3

ihnDSaNBcAA,McCann Dogs Agility,Our 1st Seminar - Kayl McCann & Bee-Line,"If you've been seeing my FB over the last few months, you've probably noticed that my life has had some heartbreak. This past weekend has helped me kick that sadness in the butt! 

This seminar was supposed to be focused around Rad (with a little a bit of Bee training). With this being my first ""Agility Event"" since losing Rad, It was hard at times to realize that I can no longer run Agility with him. But I can honestly say that this weekend I laughed and smiled and felt more happiness than I have in a long time. SO many things & people contributed to this.... The ""boys"", my friends, the environment and my special freckle face girlie.

I reached out to friends, Dave Munnings & Dan Shaw (From England) last year and asked them to come teach a seminar as I was really wanting to continue my personal education & growth in Agility. I knew they would bring something different and would give me some great idea's to build into my training. I also knew they were fun..... but I had NO idea that we would connect like we did. A weekend that was supposed to be about training Rad and focusing on Agility turned into a whole weekend of recovery and growth. 

Bee-Line had to step up to the plate and boy did she surprise me! She picked up new skills so quickly and I felt a whole new bond grow between us. Gosh, I love that little dog. I can't wait for our journey! 

I want to thank both Dave and Dan for sharing their knowledge & passion for the sport. They worked their butts off for us and brought a level of energy I rarely see from Instructors. We are a tight family here at McCann's and I can speak for all of us when I say that these boys have kicked our passion for the sport up a notch! 

I really- really appreciated the opportunity to be a student this weekend and to allow myself to just sit back and learn. I had so much fun both making mistakes and celebrating progress. I also LOVED experiencing the seminar with my friends & students. The positive vibe all weekend was so contagious. 

The time spent with D&D between the seminar days was quite possibly my favorite time.....not to take away from Agility lol... but I feel like I've made friends for life! The amount of inside jokes we created in 3 days is almost unbelievable. 

My heart is so full - I'm so grateful to the boys, to this crazy sport of Dog Agility and to the McCann Clan for helping me get back to myself. I had happy tears at the end of the seminar - lol - I'm turning into a suck! 

I hope you enjoy our Seminar Highlight Reel!",,2020-04-21T18:27:31Z,PT5M10S,hd,false,1853,55,0,15

We were seriously cut from the same cloth and I don‚Äôt think there are many people that can handle the ridiculousness of the McCann Group.  You both fit in like you‚Äôve been with us forever!  You guys were able to deliver some informative information to help everyone up their game, all while making it fun and comfortable.  Not all coaches have that quality.  We adore you both! 

The seminar was a huge success (I didn‚Äôt expect anything but....) but our time outside of the seminar was equally enjoyable to me.   SO many fun memories created. See # below üòÇ. Ken and I absolutely loved having you guys.  

To my students: I‚Äôm very proud of our Agility Student Group.  You‚Äôre talented, determined supportive of each other and best of all, have a positive attitude!  You can‚Äôt beat the vibe at a McCann Seminar! ‚ô•Ô∏è

#trainsmart 

My in-class students and online coaching club students are working on a really tricky weave entry this week! 

I thought it might be interesting to show my short training session with Bee that j had tonight.  She had some struggles.  I think it‚Äôs important to break things down in order for the dog to find success WITHOUT doing too many repetitions.  Turn the volume down because I go CRAZY when she finally gets it! üëÖ

I worked for only a couple of minutes on this skill and gave her a break.  I want to the let the lesson sit in her üß† for a bit. 

üëÄ Stay tuned for tomorrow‚Äôs session when I try to put the weave entry back in sequence, at speed - with independence! 

üí™üèªüêù 

...........Weave entry session - Part 2

Last night I posted a video of Bee üêù and I working through some tough weave entries.  I broke it down and gave her a clear idea of what I was looking for.   Then I left it at that - Short & Sweet! 

Tonight I did another 2 min session.  I started with a little reminder so that she knew what to expect and then I really challenged her!  

With solid foundation, good timing and clarity in my expectation, we worked through this in 2 training sessions which took less than 5 minutes total. 

So much fun!

These are drills from my classes this week (both in house & online).  I took inspiration from a course from the US Open last month.",,2019-12-04T14:27:13Z,PT3M31S,hd,false,1183,28,0,3

 I wanted to give you the opportunity to see 8 Ball any time you want!  I had lots of fun making this for you & Eighty was sooooo excited to help me make it.  He was in his glory getting to do all those tricks & some agility.  We both miss you soooo much, but know that he is doing well here & we are taking really good care of him for you!

I love you & miss you like crazy!

From: Kayl

* This is 8-Ball my little sisters Border Jack.  Last Year, she moved away to Jasper, Alberta to work at Jasper Park Lodge.  Unfortunately she can't have 8-Ball with her just yet, so in the mean time he is home here with us in Dundas, Ontario.  I thought it would be cute to do some training with him & make a video for her to watch anytime she was feeling homesick.

He's a pretty fun loving boy!  Enjoy :)","['8', 'BALL']",2012-12-25T17:12:48Z,PT4M41S,hd,false,520,8,0,0

hU2FUUotXZs,Iwona Golab,Fly Brave - learning dogs accurate jumping,"‚ÄúWhat if I fall?‚Äù
 Oh, but my darling, what if you fly?‚Äù

Brave flying dog training ‚úàÔ∏è

I like this exercise a lot from many reasons cause it teaches many great things (without putting excessive stress on the body):

‚û°Ô∏è it teaches dogs to be brave and feel good in the air
‚û°Ô∏è apply the right amount of force to clean the jump (accrued landing)
‚û°Ô∏è improve horizontal force production - needed for long strides and long (flat) jumping on straight lines and running dogwalks 
‚û°Ô∏è can be done in small spaces, doesn't require extra equipment (anything soft and heavy enough it's fine)
‚û°Ô∏è very easy to progress/regress if needed, many variations available - you can add spins, vary start position, add bar between (hold in your hand), add toy catch.",,2021-11-28T06:46:57Z,PT55S,hd,false,265,5,0,0

Saturday A3 (agility + jumping): Raider - 3rd place, Kite 2nd place (1st place Silvia&Bu) 
On Sunday Raider won A3 category
Grand Prix (all 6 runs from both day) Kite - 3rd place, Raider 4th place.

I didn't expect that we manage to go to EuroCup but ""physio magic"" works pretty well and finally we were able to compete. 
We've never tried running agility on the beach - so Raider and me constantly had mobility problems and Kite living up to her name (Kitesurfing) and she easilly flying over sand and set pretty cool times and get me into serious trouble in CACIAg agility 
Results: we finished 11 out of 12 runs, Kite won LA3 ex aequo with Silvia&Bu, Raider was 4th, on J3 Kite did her dis and Raider was 6th (1 bar), on CACIAg Jum Kite set the best time with 2 bars and Raider set pretty cool time with 1 bar down.
On Sunday in LA3 Raidet took 2nd place, Kite 1 bar and slighty slower than Bi, in J3 Raider 6th oplace, Kite bar and again 2nd time after Bi. On Agility CACIAg Kite finised on 3rd place nad Raider on 4th place.",['Edytor YouTube'],2013-11-11T20:57:42Z,PT9M11S,sd,false,1042,12,0,0

On Saturday Raider did a great job (2nd place in jumping), would be better if I remember the courses well and not push him to the wrong jump in agility run :)
Kite was running very nice,  2nd place in agility and in jumping she ""pops"" out of a weaves. Anyway, Alen set so nice courses ;-) that even with that mistake we took 3rd place in Saturday.
On Sunday we had Polish Championship.
On agility run Kite did amazing job, winning that run, Raider end at 4th place. 
And jumping...ehhh.... we had so nice run with Kite till she pops from weaves.... this is not in Kite style at all, she always had been very consistent with her weaves performance.

Den h√§r onlinekursen passar dig som vill komma ig√•ng med agilityhandling. Under kursen g√•r vi igenom inl√§rning av sv√§ngar, rakstr√§ckor, framf√∂rbyten och bakombyten. Vi arbetar med f√• hopphinder och tunnel. Kursen passar f√∂r hundar fr√•n ca 8 m√•nader.

Har du och din hund problem med kommunikationen p√• agilitybanan? D√• kan den h√§r kursen passa √§ven den lite mer erfarna hunden. H√§r f√•r du tips om hur du kan g√∂ra din handling tydlig f√∂r hunden, s√• att han alltid v√§nder √•t r√§tt h√•ll, f√∂ljer dina anvisningar och anpassar sina hopp efter vart ni ska h√§rn√§st.

XfQFmLfkfbU,Dogs That,5 Popular Ways To Train Your Dog With Food #170 #podcast,"If someone says to you that they are a reinforcement-based dog trainer, what does that really mean? There are a lot of ways of training dogs with food or toys. Even though they fall under the reinforcement grouping, the different types of training are all dramatically different. We‚Äôre covering what I tried in the past, what I suggest you avoid, and the most effective way to shape your dog.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ About training dogs by luring and using food or toys as a lure.
‚Ä¢ What's termed observational learning or social learning, or sometimes modelling.
‚Ä¢ About Stella the Kelpie and Bunny the Sheepadoodle using buttons to communicate.
‚Ä¢ Some of the words that dogs understand and words that excite my dogs.
‚Ä¢ What capturing behavior means and how to get a captured behavior like a stretch or talking.
‚Ä¢ About shaping, and the critical difference between two styles used to shape a behavior.
‚Ä¢ The reason I don't free shape these days and prefer layered shaping.
‚Ä¢ How to make the correct choice for the dog the obvious choice.
‚Ä¢ Why splitting behaviours down creates confidence for dogs and give you a strong foundation.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ How dogs can stress low or high and what that stress looks like.
‚Ä¢ That our human mechanics can reduce anxiety for dogs.
‚Ä¢ About practicing without your dog and how that will help minimize stress.
‚Ä¢ Why videoing will improve your training sessions and help your dog.
‚Ä¢ How I set up my training area and include stations.
‚Ä¢ That transitions are the gaps between the training, and we want them seamless.
‚Ä¢ What an efficient training session is and how to minimize your dog's repetitions.
‚Ä¢ About the importance of using Balance Breaks in your training sessions.
‚Ä¢ An answer to a listener's question about using food when training heeling.

And if you learned that that recently or find those old habits still with you, I‚Äôve got something to help! Those short sharp words spoken harshly will startle dogs and stop a behavior, but they will also create stress and anxiety for a dog. Instead, we can teach words or sounds that will interrupt our dogs and let them know what we want them to do.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ About the judgement we put on dogs when we use harsh words to stop behavior.
‚Ä¢ The way to condition a new cue to use as a positive interrupter.
‚Ä¢ How a positive interrupter should mean ""stop what you are doing and come and find me"".
‚Ä¢ When to use a positive interrupter to give your dog something different to do.
‚Ä¢ How an interrupter is not a recall cue and that your recall cue is sacred!
‚Ä¢ About choosing the best sound or word to use as a positive interrupter.
‚Ä¢ How you could use ""wit-wit-wit-wit"" as your positive interrupter.
‚Ä¢ How to easily teach your new positive interrupter to help you and your dog.
‚Ä¢ When to transition your new cue to real-life situations.
‚Ä¢ That you need to be aware of the thing before the thing and inadvertent behavior chains.

‚Ä¢ Four books about canine body language to have in your library.
‚Ä¢ How to really notice what your dog‚Äôs tail is telling you, including a left wag.
‚Ä¢ About the way dogs use their eyes to express their emotional state.
‚Ä¢ How dogs use body language to try and diffuse situations.
‚Ä¢ Why to notice what your dog‚Äôs tongue is doing and what a dog‚Äôs yawn could be saying.

DZhxta1lNV8,Dogs That,Adding Mindset To Your Dog Training Tools: Who Do You Become? #150 #podcast,"One of my most favorite things to talk about is mindset because, to me, it‚Äôs everything in life. Mindset is nothing to do with dog training, yet it has everything to do with how successful you will be. Dog training is an unregulated industry, and people can say or do whatever they want. There are many ways to train dogs, and dogs will learn despite what‚Äôs being done. Each method of training a dog will impact us personally, so we need to consider who we will become.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ That we all have goals and choices in reaching those goals.
‚Ä¢ How a dog learning will reinforce our training choices.
‚Ä¢ Why to consider what you trade off in dog training, your time or relationship.
‚Ä¢ That you need to give yourself grace when learning.
‚Ä¢ How our dog training choices carry over into other areas of our life.
‚Ä¢ What we get when you achieve a goal is not nearly as important as who we become.
‚Ä¢ That our relationship with our dogs is defined when we are frustrated.
‚Ä¢ How ethical training can be effective, but that it‚Äôs you who defines what is ethical.
‚Ä¢ About my history in dog training and how I‚Äôve changed.
‚Ä¢ Why dog sports should be a team experience with our dog.
‚Ä¢ That dog training can be different and help us become who we want to be.

v1jiG8tiAOc,Dogs That,Your Dog Listening At A Distance Part 2: Critical Timing Of Distractions #148 #podcast,"There are two ways to work on your dog listening around distractions, but many people only learn one. The first way is to get your dog into a controlled position like a sit or down, and introduce distractions. We take it to the next level and do things differently! Let‚Äôs face it; there are not too many bunnies who are going to ask us to get our dogs into a sit before they run across the path. We need our dogs to listen no matter what and no matter how far away they are from us, and the timing of our distractions in training is critical to set our dogs up for success.

In the episode you'll hear:

WtGjhPRQWoo,Dogs That,Balanced Dog Training: Does It Really Exist? #146 #podcast,"Does balanced dog training really exist? Being a balanced trainer is part of my background in dog training. In many discussions about dog training methods, you will frequently hear about the four quadrants, so I‚Äôm going over what those quadrants are and how our experiences can tip the balance. We‚Äôre covering the science of operant conditioning and how dogs actively learn.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ How I started to learn about dog training from a book called ‚ÄúHow to Raise and Train a Chow Chow‚Äù.
‚Ä¢ About the four quadrants and the meaning of +R, +P, -P and -R.
‚Ä¢ An explanation of the terms Positive Reinforcement, Positive Punishment, Negative Punishment and Negative Reinforcement.
‚Ä¢ The importance of understanding that punishment suppresses behavior.
‚Ä¢ How the key with positive reinforcement is that only the dog knows what is reinforcing.
‚Ä¢ Examples of using the four quadrants in dog training, and how we really want to optimize positive reinforcement.
‚Ä¢ The reason why no dog trainer is truly balanced.
‚Ä¢ The decision I made in 1993 only to use positive reinforcement and what I learned.
‚Ä¢ How our core values, education, curiosity, mentorship, and peer group impact our dog training.
‚Ä¢ About what pressure and frustration can do to our dog training decisions.
‚Ä¢ The most valuable lesson I learned from Feature when she was a puppy, and when I realized I‚Äôd come the full circle in my dog training.

VJc42BfNre4,Dogs That,Vet Visits For Dogs: How To Create A Positive Experience For Everyone,"There are three key areas that you can focus on to help make taking your dog to a Veterinarian as positive an experience as possible for all involved.  Following the simple and easy guidelines above can make a big difference to not only your dog but to everyone else who might be at the Veterinary Clinic.

Aim for INTENTIONAL conditioning, focusing on the following four areas:

‚ñ∫ The Veterinary Clinic itself, the building, the parking lot, the smells. Call your vet and arrange for a visit in off-peak hours so you can create a positive experience for your pet.

‚ñ∫ Wearing a muzzle. If your pet is in a lot of pain, he might not want anyone near him. A muzzle will allow your pet to be treated and keep everyone safe.

‚ñ∫ Being held. Many animals do not like being restrained. Hold your pet, give him a cookie and let him go. Start gradually and work up to other people holding your pet.

‚ñ∫ Condition your pet to a carrier, cage or crate. Set up a positive experience! Build comfort and confidence and avoid any anxiety your dog or cat may have for being in a confined space or crate. Crate Games is going to help you condition your dog to a crate for comfort and confidence.
https://get.crategames.com/yt/online

Planning for the Best Possible Experience for All

If you know you will be visiting the vet, prepare beforehand. Set out your treats, lead, carrier. Have a plan for what your visit looks like when you arrive at the vet. Plan for the best experience possible.

If your pet is reactive, it‚Äôs important to set him up for the best experience along with everyone who will be in contact with your pet. Everyone wants the best for your animals. Let your vet know ahead of time that your pet is reactive. Tell your vet how you will be arriving and what you are going to do to get to the examination room. Your vet might even have a reactive pet protocol.

Taking Action for Comfort Not Chaos

‚ñ∫ Have your focus on your pet when you enter the clinic (put your phone away).

‚ñ∫ Use appropriate equipment (a short leash rather than a retractable leash).

‚ñ∫ Don‚Äôt allow your pet to rush up to other people or animals.

‚ñ∫ Be considerate and kind to avoid chaos for everyone.

Next time you are at your Vet Clinic, let them know how much you appreciate all they do!

SsQY6nm6E30,Dogs That,15 Ways To Exercise Your Dog,"Exercising a dog is vital for their well being and studies have shown that exercise is a common factor in the longevity of dogs. Below is the list of some of the things I recommended and do with my dogs, and things you want to watch for.

1. Hiking
Ideally off leash and preferably in varied terrain. If your dog needs to be on a lead, use a harness that does not restrict his movement. 

2. Swimming
When choosing where to swim your dog, be aware of Blue-Green Algae toxicity and select your water source carefully. Also, watch for the amount of water your dog might ingest when swimming if he bites at the water or grabs at toys as Water Intoxication is a risk. 

3. Underwater Treadmill
Exercise on an underwater treadmill can be better for your dog than swimming. It can take some of the pressure off your dog‚Äôs joints. 

4. Stair Work
Your dog walking beside you up and down stairs is good for both of you! You will need to train this with your dog. You can play Stair Masters in Home School the Dog.
https://www.homeschoolthedog.com/

5. Treadmill
Treadmills are great for exercise, but I strongly suggest that the treadmill you use is one that is specifically for dogs (I use DogTread). I only use the treadmill with my dogs walking or trotting, alternating between the two, with more walking than trotting.

6. Nose Work
You can start by hiding cookies under cushions and have your dog search for them.  Chances are you might have a Nose Work class near you. Jane Book has a great online course ‚ÄúThe Dog Scents‚Äù.

7. Fitness Stations
Train and use tricks to get your dog to use his body. You can introduce fitness equipment especially for dogs, but there are many DIY options for you with things that you will have at home.

8. Recallers Games
Recallers is the foundation of all we do with our dogs, and the games not only create a brilliant relationship with our dogs but exercise bodies and minds too!
https://recallers.com/

9. Retrieve
Retrieving is fun to teach your dog and my ‚ÄúBring Me!‚Äù program is in both Recallers and Home School the Dog.

10. Cycling
Use an appropriate leash attachment and don‚Äôt hold your dog‚Äôs lead in your hand.  Have your dog on the side away from traffic, and ideally avoid traffic totally. Make sure the surface you cycle on is suitable for your dog.

11. Dog Sports
There is a multitude of sports that you and your dog can enjoy together. You all know that I love training and competing in dog agility. My two online programs for agility are Handling360 and Agility Nation.
https://connect.handling360.com/
https://www.agility-nation.com/

12. Snowshoeing or Skijoring
These are great sports for winter if you live somewhere with snowfall. Make sure that the equipment you use is safe for your dog.

13. Dog Parks
Taking your dog to a dog park might be great, or it could also be an experience you would not want your dog to have, so be cautious before letting your dog into a dog park.

14. Day Care
Like dog parks, Day Care could be very beneficial or not a good experience for your dog. Do your research when choosing Doggie Day Care.

15. Technology
Remote feeders can help us create exercise games for our dogs. There are many brands available.

Make sure you start with exercise that your dog can manage and build it up gradually if your dog has led a more sedentary lifestyle, . Before starting any specific exercise program for your dog, he should be seen by a veterinarian to ensure there are no physical limitations. If your dog has been injured, consult with a qualified canine physical therapist or rehabilitation expert about your exercise routine.

‚Ä¢ About the most common way of teaching a down with luring.

‚Ä¢ How I train dogs to down using paw or body targets to get a fast, reliable drop.
‚Ä¢ The pre-requisites you will need before training your dog to down.
‚Ä¢ Why you will need a release word to tell your dog when the down is over.
‚Ä¢ That I use ""search"", ""break"", or ""get it"" as release words and what each means.
‚Ä¢ The reason to think very carefully about the cue you will use for your dog to down.
‚Ä¢ How I train down in three different positions and why I start with the sphinx position.
‚Ä¢ How I train my dogs to down on cue with DASH and fun shaping games.

‚Ä¢ Why to be aware of competing reinforcement values.
‚Ä¢ That consistency and reinforcement are vital for our dogs to understand cues.
‚Ä¢ What overshadowing your dog is and how that relates to your body language.
‚Ä¢ How to evaluate your sit cue with a 5P test in many locations.
‚Ä¢ Why a relationship comes before training your dog to do anything.
‚Ä¢ About DASH and how Desire, Accuracy, Speed and Habitat will help your dog training.

iR_O7VLtf9s,Dogs That,Why Isn't My Dog Learning What I'm Training? #125,"In education, what the teacher is teaching, and what the learner is learning might not be the same thing. It‚Äôs the same when we are training our dogs. If what our dog does is not what we have trained, we need to look at our training to see where that might be flawed. Often it comes down to the reinforcement process, and today we‚Äôre going to fix that.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ The elements of the reinforcement process in dog training.
‚Ä¢ How to fix the way you are rewarding your dog.
‚Ä¢ About the reward process for loose leash walking.
‚Ä¢ The reason we want to catch our dogs being amazing.
‚Ä¢ Why to observe, recognize, mark, deliver and place reinforcement, release.
‚Ä¢ The reason that gaps between reward elements morph behavior.
‚Ä¢ How barking can be inadvertently rewarded.
‚Ä¢ Why to ask yourself, ‚Äúwhat did you just reward?‚Äù.
‚Ä¢ About being prepared for training to help your dog learn.
‚Ä¢ The mechanics of good reward delivery.
‚Ä¢ Why reinforcement placement builds or tears down behaviour.
‚Ä¢ How your dog will always tell you what they are learning.

X_f1hm_XhJM,Dogs That,Normalizing Imperfection in Dog Training,"I want to take off the social media ‚Äúlens‚Äù for a minute and get real‚Ä¶
Who here is struggling with training at the moment? üôã (it‚Äôs ok if you are)
I‚Äôve seen a lot of words floating around recently like‚Ä¶ ‚Äúexhausted‚Äù, ‚Äúanxious‚Äù, ‚Äúoverwhelmed‚Äù, ‚Äúpressure‚Äù, ‚Äúperfectionism.‚Äù

And I get it. 

There‚Äôs a lot going on in the world right now and so many of us are emotionally taxed‚Ä¶ sometimes we are just trying to make it through the day.

Several times over the last few weeks I‚Äôve been asked the same question from friends, from students, from people reaching out through a DM to me.

The same question:

How can I stop feeling like I‚Äôm so far behind that I‚Äôm lost?

So I started preparing this video and in the midst of preparing it, I was sent a letter asking the same question once again. 

It may be something that may help you find your path again. It may be something a friend who is struggling in silence needs to hear.

I hope this video helps you realize you‚Äôre not alone. We‚Äôre all in this together, doing the best we can, one day at a time.

With kindness and love,
Susan

Or perhaps your dog is so distracted that you can‚Äôt get their focus on you or the training?

‚Ä¢ Why not all stress is bad and why we need good stress.
‚Ä¢ About our emotional state and how the same applies to our dogs.
‚Ä¢ All the stages of arousal and how each state impacts our dog.
‚Ä¢ How focus narrows when stress goes up.

oYYdccCXNsM,Dogs That,The Thing Before The Thing #shorts,"Most dogs have something they absolutely LOVE to do! My puppy This! loves to chase birds, dogs and just running. I‚Äôve put that on cue so when she does something I ask, I can reward her with permission to do something she wants. The value of what she loves transfers to a love of what she is doing just before I give her permission. It‚Äôs the thing before the thing!

As with many Border Collies, This! is driven to run without looking forward (watching only the dog she is chasing) and cut into the path of a dog that is running. Recently on Facebook, I posted a video about how I‚Äôm working on a protocol that will keep both her and the other dogs she is walking with safe by using an incompatible behavior. In this #shorts video, I‚Äôm showing how easy it is to start using an incompatible behaviour and transfer value to that behavior.

It could all come down to the relationship you have with your dog and how that impacts the way you train your dog and communicate. There are three different sorts of relationships, and our interactions might have elements of each.

‚Ä¢ What happens with blame when rules are broken and why to check our ego.
‚Ä¢ Why control creates resistance, opposition, rebellion and can result in sneaky behavior.
‚Ä¢ About what really happens if you just want your dog to be a dog.

‚Ä¢ The ways your relationship with your dog can be exhausting for you.

‚Ä¢ Why we aim for autonomy in relationships with our dogs and what it means.
‚Ä¢ About choice based training and how that creates a dopamine release.
‚Ä¢ How our dog training decisions can create trust.
‚Ä¢ Why I ask my dogs questions and what the answers tell me.
‚Ä¢ How our relationships can help us all flourish, including our dogs.

bxx5Rnk4tYs,Dogs That,"Yes, Susan Garrett's Dogs Sniff On Walks #74","If you are like most people, you take your dog for a walk for exercise or for a potty break. Surprisingly, one of the questions I get asked frequently is when and how I walk my dogs. There are five main reasons I walk my dogs, and the walking is always intentional. Those reasons are for elimination (toilet breaks), relationship building, to give my dogs a chance to sniff (read the pee mail), exercise, and sometimes to socialize.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ The types of walks I take with my dogs.
‚Ä¢ How I walk my dogs, and when I choose off-leash or on a leash.
‚Ä¢ About Tater‚Äôs LOVE of people and what that means when walking him.
‚Ä¢ The reasons I am cautious and intentional when walking in new places.
‚Ä¢ Why I am always on alert when walking my dogs on leash in a city.
‚Ä¢ What I do to keep my dogs safe when walking in new places.
‚Ä¢ When and why I use a head halter, a harness or a flat collar.
‚Ä¢ About how I start when walking the dogs at home.
‚Ä¢ The games I play on walks with my puppy for relationship building.
‚Ä¢ About letting dogs scent on walks and sniffing to read the pee mail.

Maybe he raided something from the kitchen, and when you ask him to drop it, he swallows whatever he has. Or perhaps when you call him, he runs the other way. In Agility, you might leave your dog at the start line and say stay, but he does not stay and starts on the course before you give your release. There are two schools of thoughts to what might be happening. Is it that your dog won‚Äôt do what you tell him, or can‚Äôt do what you tell him?

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ A deep dive into the impact of what you think of your dog.
‚Ä¢ What we can learn from Fenton in Richmond Park.

l4a9NsEK9Nc,Dogs That,Help! How Can I Tell My Dog He's Wrong? #64,"Success in dog training comes down to three things. The reinforcement we are using, the training plan, and the environment where we are training our dog. But what happens when things don‚Äôt go to plan, and our dog make a wrong choice? What are our options?

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ The four reactions that are common when a dog makes a mistake.
‚Ä¢ About looking at your emotional state when you are training your dog.
‚Ä¢ The reasons building a house is like dog training.
‚Ä¢ About the use of Non Reward Markers (NRM) in dog training.
‚Ä¢ How delivering a package relates to your dog training decisions.
‚Ä¢ Why to only use a NRM when what you are teaching is a behaviour chain.
‚Ä¢ The challenge of the overuse of a Non Reward Marker.
‚Ä¢ When you should not use a NRM.
‚Ä¢ Why we train a NRM like a recall, with reinforcement, before we ever use it.
‚Ä¢ What unconscious reactions are and how they can be a mild verbal punisher.
‚Ä¢ What an intimidating verbal or physical punisher is and how that could escalate.
‚Ä¢ About what our dogs tell us about how well we‚Äôve set them up for success.
‚Ä¢ What can go wrong in training sessions (using a target stick as an example).

MzePo7RSQu4,Dogs That,Susan Garrett's Target Stick Training for Dogs Part One,"In Shaped by Dog Episode 60, I asked if you would like me to share some tips on training your dog with a target stick. The answer was a resounding ‚Äúyes‚Äù, so here‚Äôs Part One.

We‚Äôre covering more than a target stick in, as there are so many ways dogs can target and so many applications for targeting. It‚Äôs a skill I consider vital for all dogs.

Part One covers the why and where of targeting, including how useful it is for life skills and cooperative care for husbandry. There are at least 10 areas you could train your dog to target, and I use at least 5 or 6 regularly.

Targeting engages your dog‚Äôs brain and gives you many long-term benefits.

Once you've watched this video, go over to Part Two of Target Stick Training where we cover the  training steps so that you and your dog can get started with the fun:

xyTWqhA21ZE,Dogs That,Why Some Dogs Just Don't Get It #63,"The inspiration for this episode comes from a walk with my dogs. My puppy, This!, was on leash, and my adult dogs were milling about freely. All of a sudden, a large bunny crossed our path 5 meters ahead. My adult dogs did not really notice the rabbit as it was the equivalent of white noise for them. For my puppy, it was a LOUD noise, a siren, she for sure noticed! Is it that my puppy just does not get my training, or is it that she has just started her education?

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ My checklist of 5 items to include in your training to ensure your dog gets it.
‚Ä¢ The layers of learning that I put into my dog training and for my students.
‚Ä¢ What our layers of learning are from Kindergarten through to University and beyond.
‚Ä¢ Why our dogs need a structured educational program.
‚Ä¢ The reason we don‚Äôt control our dog but look at the environment.
‚Ä¢ What I do instead of saying ‚ÄúLeave It!‚Äù to my dogs.
‚Ä¢ All the things that I teach my dogs to help dim the loud noises like bunnies or cats.
‚Ä¢ Why to progress your dog‚Äôs decision making, so decisions become bigger and better.
‚Ä¢ What I do that is different to old-school dog training programs.
‚Ä¢ The importance of congruency and consistency.
‚Ä¢ Reasons why some dogs just don‚Äôt get it, including fear and a dog‚Äôs purpose.
‚Ä¢ How structured building blocks create transformation and confidence.
‚Ä¢ Why we want an engaged, safe environment that encourages learning.
‚Ä¢ About balancing success with challenges and the relationship with dopamine.
‚Ä¢ Why rehearsals of success lead to successful performances.

xjiaOy_iWyw,Dogs That,Why Your Treats Aren‚Äôt Working for Your Dog #59,"In the world of dog training, a lot of people are trying to train their dog with a focus solely on the use of reinforcement. But there can be a disparity in the success people have when using rewards. We‚Äôre going to turn the microscope on why the outcome varies between trainers, why it‚Äôs happening, and what we can do about it so everyone can have success.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ The reasons that animal training fails.
‚Ä¢ How to get brilliant at understanding and using reinforcement values.
‚Ä¢ What motivational currency is for your dog.
‚Ä¢ The difference between a commemorative coin and a thousand dollars an hour.
‚Ä¢ Why to vary the treats you give your dog when training.
‚Ä¢ How different locations and activities can require differing rewards.
‚Ä¢ The food rewards I use with my dogs and how I rank those rewards.
‚Ä¢ My exact formula for what reinforcement to use when.
‚Ä¢ Why to consider your dog‚Äôs uncertainty and distraction value.
‚Ä¢ How to rank a reward‚Äôs motivational currency and the scale to use.
‚Ä¢ The reason frequency changes the value of a reinforcer.
‚Ä¢ Why I use high value treats for husbandry behaviors and how I transfer value.

Susan Garrett‚Äôs Reinforcement Formula:
RV Greater Than DU + DV
RV = Reinforcement Value

I believe our dogs put our words into five categories, and I‚Äôm covering each cue category and how it relates to what we say to our dog.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ How many words dogs can respond to and understand.
‚Ä¢ What words our dogs will ignore and how that can be inadvertent.
‚Ä¢ Why there are words that can be confusing for our dogs.
‚Ä¢ How words can make our dogs happy.
‚Ä¢ The importance of the tone of our verbal cues.
‚Ä¢ About the words that can create stress and fear for dogs.
‚Ä¢ Why sit means sit and importance of a release word.
‚Ä¢ The one word I never use.
‚Ä¢ Why some words are ignored or confusing for our dog.
‚Ä¢ My best advice on selecting cues for your dog.
‚Ä¢ How some dogs only have micro-seconds to respond to a cue.
‚Ä¢ About the release cue ‚Äúbreak‚Äù that I use and one I don‚Äôt recommend.
‚Ä¢ How you can easily change a word to one that will bring your dog clarity.

wBs5froI2a4,Dogs That,Is Your Dog Trying to Dominate You and What You Can Do About It #46,"The topic of this episode comes from a listener suggestion, and it is about ‚Äúalpha‚Äù and ‚Äúbeta‚Äù dogs. It‚Äôs a bit of a spicy subject, and the words ‚Äúalpha‚Äù and ‚Äúbeta‚Äù go back to disproven ‚Äúdominance theory‚Äù. Even if you are not sure what ‚Äúdominance theory‚Äù is, you might have heard the term ‚Äúpack leader‚Äù. It was common around 30 or so years ago for pet dog training classes to be based on ‚Äúdominancy theory‚Äù, but not so much these days. Each of us has filter we see the world through, and that filter is going to have an impact on our dog training choices and beliefs.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ What influenced the filters through which I see the world.
‚Ä¢ How my filter has an impact on my dog training.
‚Ä¢ What I ask if something goes wrong with my dogs.
‚Ä¢ The commonalities and digressions I‚Äôve noticed in training beliefs.
‚Ä¢ What I googled about dominance theory.
‚Ä¢ My quick diversion on humping.
‚Ä¢ How what we see in our dogs can be interrupted in different ways.
‚Ä¢ The ways our filters relate to our dog training decisions and how changing our filters is possible for everyone.
‚Ä¢ That behavior is behavior, for humans and for dogs, and how choice and communication is powerful for any relationship.
‚Ä¢ How my puppy This! shredded a bed and my reaction.
‚Ä¢ The three things you can do when faced with a challenge with your dog.
‚Ä¢ Why it‚Äôs time to get curious when you are furious.
‚Ä¢ What can go into a plan for you to get what you want with your dog.

‚Ä¢ What my goal is when I am raising a dog.
‚Ä¢ How to look at life from the eyes of your dog and arrange coincidences.
‚Ä¢ A real-life example of coincidences with a puppy.
‚Ä¢ How positive associations can come through you.
‚Ä¢ The dog training progressions that I‚Äôve been using for many years.
‚Ä¢ How you can start again right now.

‚Ä¢ How layering of confidence lets you advance your training.
‚Ä¢ What the mid-level on my training progressions chart looks like and how choice is in play.

3R6ZyJve0TU,Dogs That,Can a Dog be Happy and Well Trained? #43,"Would you like a well-behaved dog at the expense of having a happy dog? How do we define happy? Would you be willing to make your dog a little sad, confused, anxious, stressed to be well-behaved? With every dog I have ever owned my approach to training has become a little more Zen-like. Trust in me is important for my dogs to be part of my family, and part of the life I lead.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ What I was taught in the ‚Äò80s about house training, and what I do now.
‚Ä¢ Why my dogs are such characters.
‚Ä¢ The ‚Äúso what....‚Äù question to ask yourself.
‚Ä¢ More about what I was taught in the ‚Äò80s relating to puppy biting.
‚Ä¢ About increasing or decreasing trust and happiness for dogs.
‚Ä¢ Why what we learn first is what we learn best, and how we can change.
‚Ä¢ How kindness should extend to ourselves.
‚Ä¢ About the clarity my dogs have for rules and how that gives them freedom.
‚Ä¢ How our dogs take on our emotions.
‚Ä¢ The reason to plan your responses to what your dog does.
‚Ä¢ That clarity is the opposite of anxiety and how certainty helps dogs.
‚Ä¢ Why the choice is ours on who we are for our dogs.
‚Ä¢ How our dogs can help us to become more compassionate.

GGJkfrMje2k,Dogs That,How to Train Your Dog to Leave It with No Command,"How to Train Your Dog to Leave It with No Command

There are many reasons to train your dog to ‚Äúleave it‚Äù on command. Your puppy or dog might be grabbing scraps off the ground when you are out walking, raiding the garbage, stealing food off the table or counter. It‚Äôs not safe for your dog, and it is frustrating for you.

The downside of training ‚Äúleave it‚Äù on command is that you‚Äôll have to be there to say it to your dog for life. And perhaps one day your dog is off the lead, away from you, can‚Äôt hear your ‚Äúleave it‚Äù and grabs something that is life-threatening. What I like to do is teach my dogs to leave things alone by making it their choice. It all starts with a game I call ItsYerChoice because it teaches dogs to make the choices we want them to make. It removes the need for us to always be micromanaging what our dogs are doing.

The ItsYerChoice game will even help your dog make great choices in the face of big distractions. You‚Äôll be able to get your dog‚Äôs attention just by saying your dog‚Äôs name, or any word you want to use. I‚Äôve got a demonstration of how it looks in the foundation stages here in this video with my dog Momentum.

ItsYerChoice has not only worked for me; it‚Äôs worked for tens of thousands of my students and their dogs of all ages, breeds, shapes and sizes and backgrounds. You can join us to learn one simple dog training game that will change your dog‚Äôs approach to distractions and release you from needing to say ‚Äúleave it‚Äù and nagging your dog many times a day: https://recallers.com/iycsummit-join

When you join in, you and your puppy or dog will receive a free 20 minute training video and a step by step Play Book to help your dog get control over distractions. My foundation game teaches dogs HOW to make great choices to ‚Äòleave‚Äô food / toys / distractions. This is DIFFERENT! And because it‚Äôs a game, it‚Äôs fun, and we all learn best when we are having fun.

Looking forward to coaching you on how to get your dog to leave it because that is what your dog chooses to do. Join me to learn how IYC can change your life with your dog:

See you soon!

qsHK--RoRjs,Dogs That,Understanding and Preventing Reactivity and Aggression in Your Dog #29,"Today‚Äôs topic covers the serious issue of reactivity and aggression in dogs. If you have a challenge with your dog, I strongly advise that you seek out the help of a Certified Veterinary Behaviorist who is equipped to deal with these issues in a reinforcement-based program. Seek the help of a qualified professional who will, where needed, use pharmaceutical intervention to help create a different reality for your dog, so your dog does not go through life feeling the need to react.

I‚Äôm sharing how what is ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù can lead to reactivity or aggression, and how a lot of aggression is learned. It‚Äôs not that there is something wrong with the dog. You can help your dog to catalogue experiences in a way that is appropriate for their well being and yours.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ Insights into why aggression can be a learned behavior.
‚Ä¢ How you and your dog can have better outcomes.
‚Ä¢ What stimulus is, and what‚Äôs good, innocuous and not good for your dog.
‚Ä¢ Understanding stimuli from your dog‚Äôs perspective.
‚Ä¢ Why ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù creates a response in your dog.
‚Ä¢ How your dog‚Äôs curiosity could lead to reactivity.
‚Ä¢ What a dog‚Äôs cautious curiosity can look like.
‚Ä¢ The importance of what happens during and after our dog displaying curiosity for something that is different.
‚Ä¢ The two strategies you need for changing a trigger and minimizing the stress of an experience for your dog.
‚Ä¢ Why you should believe what your dog is telling you.
‚Ä¢ What you can do to help your dog.

ILFXA4zXVHY,Dogs That,What Is Your Identity as a Dog Owner? #23,"Things have been a little weird around here because six days ago we welcomed a litter of four puppies. One of these puppies will be my next dog, and it got me thinking about how I identify myself and how that relates to my dogs. And it is the same for you. Your identity matters for you and your dog.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ The importance of how you identify yourself.
‚Ä¢ Why our dog is always getting trained either through conscious effort or our dog‚Äôs
experimentation.
‚Ä¢ When to transition from a newbie identity, but how being an expert can hurt you.
‚Ä¢ Why accolades and accomplishments are events rather than identifiers.
‚Ä¢ How I identify myself.
‚Ä¢ About going from information gathering to taking action.
‚Ä¢ Why I‚Äôm excited about my new puppy and for any new mistakes I might make.
‚Ä¢ Things your dog does not care about if you get training wrong.
‚Ä¢ What creates forward momentum.

It‚Äôs not the sort of pressure to make sure your dog‚Äôs leash matches the collar, or for your dog to be looking good in front of your friends. It‚Äôs the bubble of pressure that surrounds all dogs.

In the episode you'll hear:

iYgTuOw5Cag,Dogs That,The 5 Critical Dog Training Layers for Confidence with Anything #21,"We all have vivid childhood memories, and one of mine involving my friend‚Äôs dog Chuka had a lasting impact. In all my dog training, I look to grow confidence and capability for dogs in any environment. I do that using the model of my 5C Pyramid. Now, you might already be familiar with the 5C Pyramid for Success, but I‚Äôve got a couple of tweaks to the layers you‚Äôll want to hear.
It all starts with our connection with our dogs and knowing the questions to ask, so we can be sure that our dog can meet our expectations. And for everyone who had queries from Episode 19 about what ‚Äúsit‚Äù really means for a dog, I‚Äôm using that behaviour today as an example. We‚Äôre covering all the layers for confidence in anything you want to train your dog to do.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ About my memory of Chuka, how the same thing happens to many dogs, and how it can be avoided.
‚Ä¢ What my 5C model is and tweaks to the pyramid layers.
‚Ä¢ Why the first layer of connection is the most vital of all.
‚Ä¢ What engagement with your dog looks like.
‚Ä¢ Why your dog can experiment and how that allows you to evaluate.
‚Ä¢ What splitting a behaviour down really means.
‚Ä¢ The three forms of challenges with distance, duration, and distractions.
‚Ä¢ What is too much pressure for your dog and for you.
‚Ä¢ How you can use the same model for your confidence!
‚Ä¢ Important questions to ask before you take off your dog‚Äôs leash.

Ep6wzXdCbxg,Dogs That,Bridging the Gap Between Blame and Kindness in Dog Training #20,"If you are here, chances are you have an interest in how to train a dog without punishment or blame. When you are moving away from training with physical corrections, intimidation, or verbal corrections, you can fall into what I call ‚Äúthe gap‚Äù. If your dog is digging in the garden, has paws on the counter, has jumped in the pond or is chasing a cat, you freeze. The old lessons come to your head telling you to ‚Äústop the dog and punish‚Äù. You want to leave that behind and fall into ‚Äúthe gap‚Äù because you don‚Äôt know what to do.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ How our dogs are doing the best they can with the education we have given them in the environment that we are asking them to work in.
‚Ä¢ About Do-Land where no babies cry, all the birds sing, and there are unicorns and rainbows.
‚Ä¢ When I became aware of ‚Äúthe gap‚Äù through my friend Lynda Orton-Hill and her Golden Retriever, Spirit.
‚Ä¢ How to move on from blame and judgement.
‚Ä¢ Why ‚Äúpositive is not permissive‚Äù and how training with positive reinforcement does
not mean we have no guidelines.
‚Ä¢ The 2 things you can do when you are in ‚Äúthe gap‚Äù.
‚Ä¢ How I learned to ‚Äúbang head here‚Äù from my mentors Bob and Marian Bailey.
‚Ä¢ Why my training structure for dogs to be amazing family pets creates excellence
in my dogs for world level agility competition.
‚Ä¢ How Do-Land is possible for everyone!

1OEEJEf59_4,Dogs That,One of My Biggest Pet Peeves in Dog Training #19,"We all have pet peeves, and one of mine is the misuse of dog training cues. Cues have power, and it is important to maintain our dog‚Äôs clarity and understanding. Most cues are verbs because we want our dogs to do something. It‚Äôs vital not to dilute a cue as that will create uncertainty in our dog about what we really want him to do.

In the episode you'll hear:
‚Ä¢ How dogs don‚Äôt understand past tense.
‚Ä¢ The reason we should never say ‚Äúgood sit‚Äù or ‚Äúgood down‚Äù.
‚Ä¢ The importance of questioning dog training experts.
‚Ä¢ Why cues have a lot of power and value for our dogs.
‚Ä¢ The ways cues are misused.
‚Ä¢ Why a cue is a verb and not a description.
‚Ä¢ What dilutes a dog‚Äôs understanding of a cue.
‚Ä¢ Controversy surrounding cues and why I don‚Äôt say ‚Äústay‚Äù.
‚Ä¢ How mixing physical cues and verbal cues can create conflict for your dog.

Vk7vgpURS6s,Dog Training by Kikopup,Fundraiser for Service Dog Team Tamandra and Jedi,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm Emily Larlham a Professional Dog Trainer in San Diego CA.  I have started this GoFundMe for a service dog team Tamandra and Jedi the Belgian Malinois so that they can have a custom made manual wheelchair that best suits their needs for mobility, health and also service dog work and training! 

Tamandra‚Äôs manual wheel chair at the moment is not perfectly suited for her physical needs or dog training needs.  I am raising money for a custom made titanium chair created specifically for her needs by a small business here in San Diego, CA that makes custom manual wheelchairs. This chair will not only be beneficial for physical and dog training needs, but also this specific chair will be life changing in that it will allow this service dog team to get out in nature and go on trails her other chair cannot go.

The total for her custom-made chair designed specifically for her and Jedi that I wish to raise is $8,990.17 (which includes 8.25% sales tax fee of $685.17).  Every small donation will help purchase this chair which will last a lifetime and change Tamandra and her dogs Jedi the Belgian Malinois and Tyrion the Border Terrier lives for the better.  Sharing this fundraiser is also greatly appreciated.  Tamandra is a good friend of mine who I have known for over 17 years and who I met at the first dog training seminar I attended.

I will post a thank you video after I purchase the wheelchair on my youtube channel Kikopup, as well as post it on my personal facebook page Emily Larlham and business facebook page Dogmantics Dog Training.  You can donate and share the fundraiser by following this link : https://gofund.me/f892608a

Every donation no matter how small is helpful and greatly appreciated

During two weeks in the spring of this year Cloud began killing squirrels.  Emily talks about how this specific case had an extremely simple solution with very little training and describes the two aspects of why she thinks this was so.  Emily will continue to create videos on predation from time to time on this youtube channel.  

Here are a list of videos on working with predation and prey drive:

_jTkssmZp-A,Dog Training by Kikopup,How to train your Service Dog to be bombproof to unexpected reactive dogs in stores,"This video is for service dog teams who want to train their dog to be calm and confident when a dog suddenly charges, snaps, lunges or barks aggressively at their dog in a store or when out and about.  This is also a great tutorial for those who want have a friendly dog who they would like to bring to dog friendly cafes and dog friendly shops where it can be common that another dog might lunge at them.  This video can also be used as the final step for training dogs who have had issues with reactivity, with the help of a trainer to guide your through the steps so they can help you with when to raise and lower criteria. In NO WAY does this video condone training fake service dogs so you can go places pet dogs aren't allowed by law. Also even if you don't have a reactive dog you might want to hire a trainer to help you work with your service dog on this issue as it can be hard to break up criteria especially when moving onto extremely unpredictable circumstances. When in doubt, stick as much as you can to training set up where nothing can go wrong and you are using helpers and decoy dogs you trust. 

Here is the protocol for working with dogs in training setups:

dNXwR7RoGMs,Dog Training by Kikopup,Harnessing the Hunter - Building your relationship & reliability with a hunting dog,"A brief overview of the video I created with Tawzer Dog in 2013 entitled Harnessing the Hunter - Building your relationship & reliability with a hunting dog. I include video examples of my protocol for working on predation issues in dogs using before and after footage.  There are many methods to train dogs, in this video I use Progressive Reinforcement Training, this is a way of training that doesn't involve the use of intentional physical or psychological intimidation.  One reason I really like this method is that the hunting behaviors are instinctual so instead of punishing them, you can get the dog to want to do the alternative behaviors you want and choose interacting with you and listening to you over chasing prey.

Product Description
Harnessing the Hunter: Building your relationship & reliability with a hunting dog

Here is the link to the video on demand:  https://dogmantics.com/product/harnessing-the-hunter-vod/

This streamed video covers the most important foundation behaviors and exercises to train your hunting dog in order to build your relationship and gain reliability around prey. The tutorials will cover exercises to lower arousal and stress, build attention, proof important behaviors, and teach impulse control. These techniques are not only useful for those who have hunting breeds and never want them to hunt, but also for people who do want to hunt with their dog, but would like their dog to have an off switch from hunting. However, this video will not cover how to teach a dog to hunt, only how to get reliability of behaviors around prey. Emily came up with the idea to make this video while training her spouse‚Äôs two rescued hunting dogs. Trisch, her Podenco was one of the most stressed and excitable dogs she had ever seen around prey. She would literally make herself sick after seeing an animal on leash, or pursuing an animal off leash. After lunging, barking, and screaming madly or simply seeing an animal, her eyes would get bloodshot, her ears would go bright red, and she would have allergies for the next 3 days, scratching herself until she bled and being in a high state of arousal. Emily knew she had to put a stop to this, not only for her own piece of mind, but for Trisch‚Äôs well-being and happiness too.

y1r69BlG57U,Dog Training by Kikopup,Down when moving - Dog Training Tip of the day,"A professional dog training tip that quickly covers teaching the behavior of having your dog drop into a down on a verbal cue from a moving heel position.  This is a fun obedience game that will impress your friends and get people interested in training their dogs. It's not a hard behavior to teach! Give it a try!  If your dog can't go into a sit or down because of injury or age, you can do stand instead which is actually more impressive to some people. 

Happy Training!

In this video I train my little 6 month old terrier mix Cloud to stand stay with duration for the first time and wait for the release cue.

Today's tip is on ADDING DISTRACTIONS!  The key take away is setting up the environment at first to be non distracting so YOU are the one who is adding the distractions, and can control when they happen and at what intensity.  You can also this way control the power of the reinforcers you have.  Where if you go out in a distracting environment to begin with, it can leave a lot to chance with how successful the training will be and you cannot control everything. The goal however, is to work on the different distractions one at a time add them together and then what you have is a bomb proof behavior that can function in super distracting environments.

Nbkv73KU0sw,Dog Training by Kikopup,MYTH BUSTING! Ignore your dog when they are scared.,"There is a lot of information out therethat says you shouldn‚Äôt pay attention to your dog if they‚Äôre acting fearful or scared, because you might reinforce the behaviors they‚Äôre doing when they‚Äôre fearful. I believe this would only be true if you had a very unhealthy relationship with your dog and you were only paying attention to them when they were fearful of things‚Ä¶ The same with human beings. I suggest instead of ignoring your dog when they‚Äôre scared, Show them that you aren‚Äôt scared, build her confidence, build their trust in you, and show them what you do want them to do in that situation and how it can be beneficial for them as well as how they can learn to trust your guidance.

In the video, I am in the little dog park with my dogs at a time that they‚Äôre very calm friendly small dogs for them to interact with. The larger dog is going into the larger dog area to the right. I don‚Äôt have my little dogs in the larger dog area because a big dog just chasing a ball could injure my dogs.

lABx8vmxNJU,Dog Training by Kikopup,THE DEFAULT LEAVE IT from other dogs' stuff - Professional Dog Training,"This video covers how to train your dog using positive reinforcement, to leave other dogs alone when they are eating chews and playing with toys.  The key is reinforcing them for the default leave it in set up training sessions, rather than trying to train ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù when the dog is already doing the unwanted behavior. So a great training plan consists of teaching the dog what you do want him to do and reinforcing him for it, using management and prevention in between training and if the unwanted behavior happens interrupt it and redirect the dog to the behavior you do want him to do, but if the unwanted behavior keeps happening frequently it means that you need to rethink your training plan.

If you have a dog who is unpredictable, guards food or you just have never worked with food or toys with your dogs, you should get a positive reinforcement trainer to help you with this exercise, as well as play it safe and have the dogs on a leash and harness out of reach from each other, in a crate or behind a safe barrier from each other to begin with.

This video is not suggesting one method is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than the other, it‚Äôs simply an explanation of the dog and puppy training choices I make to specifically build a positive emotional response and the desired behavior in the dog.  The goal is not only a puppy or adult dog that is safe and doing the behaviors we want but a dog that also feels safe, calm, confident and finds the interactions with us a positive experience. After discussing why I use these specific methods for training a puppy not to be mouthy and how to teach a puppy to be calm with restraint, I then have included all the video tutorials I‚Äôve created on these topics on how to train the behaviors from start to finish.

This series of service dog training videos are for service dog teams working on teaching their dog to be calm, confident, reliable and safe in public spaces where dogs are allowed as well as where only service dogs are allowed. However, these tutorials and tips are great for everyone who wants a confident, well-behaved dog to bring places that pet dogs are allowed to go in public. In no way does this video condone training a fake service dog to bring places pet dogs are not allowed. Instead, if you have a pet dog, the goal of this training is to be able to go places like parks, boardwalks, city streets, outdoor dog friendly cafes and restaurants and stores that do not sell food and have a policy where pet dogs are allowed to enter.

ELn9_TPoeK4,Dog Training by Kikopup,How I film my youtube dog training videos,"You can thank my Kikopup members for voting this video into existence ‚ò∫  
This video is about my filming setup for creating dog training tutorials. 

I don‚Äôt do any sorts of sponsorship of products.  These just happen to be the things I use for creating videos.  The Iphone of course is the easiest to whip out and film something for instagram videos.  I think the product that really was a game changer for me was the Rode mic, it really made my videos sound quality jump up a notch to the professional level. Again I said Im not a sponsor of these products just giving an honest review.  The light boxes I chose were just based on affordability and speed of delivery on amazon (lol- Im impatient when it comes to getting stuff I want hehe).  The Canon AX11 I found counterintuitive to use, I much prefer the ease of the Canon D70 that I own it makes sense to me. As I said Id wished Id gotten the D80 because it has better video features. 

These are the links to the mic and the lights I use that work great for the set up I have. I also suggest putting daylight bulbs instead of soft white bulbs in the roof  so that the light is white and not yellow from above.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TV90DX0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1


The editing software I use is the free Imovie program for simple jobs and then Final Cut Pro for more advanced stuff.  I find by using nice lighting and a nice mic I don‚Äôt have to do much besides cut the clips and put them in the order I want and add the voiceover. 


Happy filming!

ssAN_1IWbEU,Dog Training by Kikopup,Down on JUST the VERBAL CUE - real time training with a puppy,"This video is a real time training session with my puppy Cloud learning to respond to just a verbal cue for down.  There are many methods for training a dog to respond to just a verbal cue. In this video I go over two methods.  One is to repeat the same cue and hand signal multiple times and then see if the dog offers the behavior after just the verbal cue.  The other is to get the dog to start offering the down behavior after eating a treat and then add the verbal cue just after the dog has eaten the treat.  With the second method you want to add your verbal cue fast and not wait too many training sessions or the dog could learn to lay down when you just sit still or are in that specific room or location as those will become part of the cue.

vjoECGMUZw0,Dog Training by Kikopup,Teaching the dog to do more than 1 behavior before a treat - Puppy and Dog Training,"Hi everyone! This is a video of training my own 13 week old terrier mix puppy Cloud how to do more than 1 behavior for a treat in a training session. Sometimes time goes by where you might be focused on training something new or training many new behaviors that you can forget to work on this skill and then need to brush up on it. I got carried away training a lot of different things so we are back on track now where I am also working on teaching Cloud to do more than 1 behavior for a treat without getting frustrated.  Both of us are a little off our game in this video because I am filming when I have a migrane headache and hes been putting up with living with someone having a migrane.  You can see this is just the start. The key is patience, after a couple of sessions well be on a roll, but in this session you can see that he got confused when he did not get a treat after every behavior.  Its just a matter of practicing it and reverting to the 1 to 1 schedule afterward so the dog still stays motivated and having a good time.  

Happy Training!

Find out more about this month's Special Guest! 

Hi, I‚Äôm Ryan, the founder of Animal Training Academy. Since 2007, I‚Äôve been working as a professional animal trainer around the world,  including in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the US. I‚Äôve trained teams, developed animal training programs, been published in leading industry magazines, spoken at international conferences and delivered presentations in a University on animal behavior

And through the Animal Training Academy, I connect hundreds of animal behavior & training enthusiasts with a large (and growing) library of lessons and tutorials delivered by renowned animal experts.
----
What did you want to be when you grew up ‚Ä¶ ?

""I remember doing one of those computer tests in high school where you answer a bunch of questions and it‚Äôs meant to tell you what occupation you should do. I actually got told to be a builder, which didn‚Äôt sound very exciting. The friend sitting next to me came out with  ‚Äòzoo-keeper‚Äô ‚Äì now that sounded much more fun. That‚Äôs when I decided I was going to work with animals.

After school, I attended University and acquired a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology and then I started volunteering wherever I could and meeting as many people as possible to try and get started in a career in zoology.

It was a wedge tail eagle in Cairns that gave me my first taste of training success and changed my life forever. Training Bob the wedge tail eagle gave me the opportunity to learn and practically apply positive reinforcement animal training.

Since this time, I‚Äôve worked in many different zoos, across numerous countries in lots of different teams and with many different species. Working across different organizations I was consistently presented with opportunities to develop new animal training programs based on my experience.

After doing this for a decade I saw an opportunity to take what I was already doing and reach a much bigger audience, helping more trainers and animals. Animal Training Academy was born mid-2015.""

I realize in the video I said I leave my dogs in the car and rotate them- I always stay within sight of my car and only do it when it's super cold, and if I am worried I leave the doors open with them in the crates and stay in sight, walking in loops past to see if they are still cool. Or if its hot I leave some at home and walk the others. I also take the dogs on individual outings, to have one on one time. thought I would clear that up instead of refilming the video that was super hard to make.","['border collie', 'blue merle border collie', 'dog trainer', 'best dog trainer', 'professional dog training', 'dog training', 'dog training youtube', 'youtube dog trainer', 'best youtube dog training channel', 'splash the border collie', 'positive training', 'positive reinforcement training', 'clicker training', 'how to train a dog', 'kikopup', 'emily larlham', 'dogmantics', 'dog training tutorials', 'dog training tips', 'online dog training', 'online puppy training']",2021-12-24T02:11:46Z,PT4M58S,hd,false,18923,996,0,183

EGKE1hY49RA,Dog Training by Kikopup,Tips for Adding a Verbal Cue - Examples Down and Spin,"This video goes over tips for teaching a dog or puppy to perform a behavior on just the verbal and not the visual cue.  My puppy Bliss is 17 weeks old (hes a big boy at 25 pounds already!) and he does not know yet to offer a behavior on just a verbal cue for the behaviors of down and spin. So in this video I show you the process of getting to the point where he understands just the word means to do the behavior without the hand gesture or treat lure. 

I forgot to mention in the video that before adding a cue, its a good idea to do at least 3-5 short training sessions on the behavior with using luring or targeting before asking for the behavior just on a verbal cue with a green learner.  With an experienced learner with many behaviors on a verbal cue only, sometimes they can learn a new cue in just a matter of repetitions! But if your dog is really struggling its a matter of just doing a couple short 1-2 min lessons before seeing if the dog can then offer the behavior.  

Happy Training!

WBbNvPXVVJA,Dog Training by Kikopup,"Learn to Train Service Dog Task ""Find"" by Expert Brigitte van Gestel","I am very honored and delighted to have world-renowned trainer Brigitte van Gestel as a special guest on this channel with a tutorial for training service dogs. Brigitte is not only known for her skills as a service dog trainer but also for her talents in pet dog training, Competition Obedience and Canine Freestyle.  

I was lucky enough to host one of her seminars on Obedience when I was living in Sweden and since that seminar my skills at training heelwork increased by 1000 times. 

Brigitte has the ability to break up the training steps so the dog and human find the learning process extremely easy and reinforcing yielding extremely reliable results.  She was one of my earliest training inspirations over 16 years ago and she still is one of my biggest inspirations in my training.

Brigitte van Gestel is the driving force behind Canine Company, which is a unique training center for dogs and handlers where individual attention and customization are of paramount importance. Brigitte van Gestel has been training various types of dogs for years with a mission on behalf of KNGF guide dogs. She is also active at a high level in dog dance and English obedience with her own Border Collies.

Canine Company is located in Hilvarenbeek and, in addition to a theory room and beautiful interior space (8 x 12 metres), also has an artificial grass pitch (10 x 15 metres). 

The lessons that Canine Company provides have mainly an individual character, so that the exercises can be tailored to the possibilities and challenges of the dog and handler.In addition, thematic workshops are offered in small groups.

mB_mct53ME0,Dog Training by Kikopup,Protocol for Raising Criteria for Emotional and Behavioral Modification,"This is an in depth professional dog training video tutorial on the Protocol for Raising Criteria for Emotional and Behavioral Modification By Emily Larlham. This video is on how to raise criteria when trying to change a dog‚Äôs behaviors and emotions in training set ups in regards to something that previously has made him act fearful, reactive, over-excited or aggressive.  This video uses the example of a dog reacting to other dogs, but the protocol can be used for anything. I will create more videos using other examples of triggers as well as show what to do next if working on introductions. 

A big than you to my friend Joanna Chang and Gummy Bear the Aussie for helping me create this video that I know will help so many dogs and their people!  I am also extremely grateful to all the dogs I have worked with as well as mentors and trainers I have learned from around the world.  

If you have a dog who can become fearful, reactive or over excited around people or dogs I suggest getting help from a professional trainer who doesn‚Äôt use any forms of physical or psychological intimidation to help you create the plan for the set ups and help you find appropriate decoy dogs and people to use.

nj_QdyAycfw,Dog Training by Kikopup,Puppy Full Length Daily Training Session,"This is video footage of a daily training session with my 9 week old puppy.  In the session I worked on teaching the puppy the first lesson of staying on a bed with distractions, offering the behavior of going to the bed, luring the puppy as a behavior using leg weaving and going in a circle, conditioning the puppy to the sound of the dremmel, and a little bit of handling. If I wasn't filming this or if the puppy lost interest in the food I would have broken this up into 2 or 3 separate training sessions spread throughout the day, working on the calm behaviors together and the more excitable ones in a different session. This is all the training we will do for today besides when I take my older Border Collie to the vet this evening and I will give him treats for being calm in his crate which will end up being part of his kibble for his dinner because we went through quite a lot of his daily ration with this training session as I had to reinforce him for doing nothing while I talked to you guys.  The next training sessions I will not talk over, and just concentrate on training my puppy in short sessions as I did these two long sessions 2 days in a row. I might also only focus on 1 behavior in 1 short lesson instead of switching it up.

lh7lHcyoKJE,Dog Training by Kikopup,Why not to punish warning signs - when using Positive Reinforcement methods to train dogs,"This short video goes over why a trainer who uses Positive Reinforcement methods for an emotional and behavioral modification plan would avoid using intentional punishment in response to a dog‚Äôs warning signs, undesirable behavior or when the dog goes over-threshold. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt punish a growl‚Äù is common knowledge in a lot of dog training communities, as the problem with that is the dog can possibly start to hide their warning signs and might skip to the next step such as biting, without communicating discomfort beforehand in the future.  Emily expands this concept to other behaviors that signal the dog is getting stressed or going over threshold when using counter conditioning or training a dog an alternate appropriate behavior.  Emily also discusses what would be done instead, which is to cue the dog to do a highly trained alternate behavior such as a recall or leave it that has been trained and conditioned using Positive Reinforcement.  

Here is a link to training 10 interrupter cues using Positive Reinforcement:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr3ame9Ptk
 
That being said, the learner is the one who decides what is punishing.  So it‚Äôs important that the trainer is able to know how to properly reinforce, condition and use the interrupter behaviors so they don‚Äôt end up inadvertently turning into punishers, as well as to be able to read the dog‚Äôs body language to see how they respond to the cues and constantly monitor to see what affect they have on the dog, and adjust training accordingly. The goal of the training plan is to avoid the animal rehearsing the undesirable behaviors as much as possible as a new behavior and emotional response is being conditioned.  So if the warning signs and undesirable behaviors continue to happen I suggest drastically rethinking the training set up.  I suggest if you notice something undesirable happens 3 times within the training session, it‚Äôs time to stop and rethink the training plan and how the environment is set up.","['best dog trainer', 'youtube dog training', 'professional dog training', 'professional dog trainer', 'positive training', 'positive reinforcement training', 'how to train a dog', 'how to train a puppy', 'dog warning signs', 'dog aggression', 'dog fear', 'dog reactivity', 'working with reactive dogs', 'dog training reactivity', 'dog training aggression', 'counter conditioning', 'desensitization', 'dog body language', 'puppy training']",2021-06-28T03:18:29Z,PT5M36S,hd,false,12348,680,0,80
PfYjZTr_XeI,Dog Training by Kikopup,STOP PULLING toward places that are FUN,"Does your dog pull you to the dog park? Pull you to your car? Or pull you to where you play fetch? Pull you when you cross the road? Pull toward a bush to sniff?   Then this video is for you.  This video goes over different techniques to break the steps up of what to train so that the dog isn‚Äôt so over excited during the training that they are unable to focus or take treats or play with toys with you.  These are also great proofing games for loose leash walking in general. The tutorial shows how you train your dog to stay with you using toys if the dogs motivation is to get somewhere to play with you, as well as shows you how to train your dog using food if your dog is wanting to pull you somewhere.

Here is a link to my 6 week self study leash walking course called Leash Walking CONNECTED: https://dogmantics.com/product/leash-walking-connected/

Adult dog tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4vEayrRyB0&

Lower excitement or arousal for toys: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWZn--78JDM

If there were one exercise I think every dog should learn if they have to abide by leash laws, it is this one. If you want to know why some people struggle with a dog who pulls on leash, besides the issue of over-arousal, it is because they haven‚Äôt yet trained and proofed this behavior. The giving into leash pressure game teaches your puppy what to do when he hits the end of the leash, which is to turn around and come back to you. By training and conditioning leash pressure in small enough approximations it is possible to turn what is usually a frustrating and aversive experience into a cue that has a positive association to the dog that simply means ‚Äúmove with me‚Äù. A lot of people believe certain stimuli are ‚Äúintrinsically‚Äù reinforcing or punishing. But this is simply untrue. It is possible through training and conditioning to change an animal‚Äôs emotional response to a certain stimuli. Instead of just relying on habituation, where dogs learn over repetition that being moved by you on leash isn‚Äôt terrible I suggest playing these training games to make it an experience where the dog doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs some sort of intimidation game. I also suggest doing the same with teaching a dog to be picked up as well as handled and groomed. A lot of trainers use something called pressure and release, which basically the reinforcer for the animal is to avoid the feeling of the pressure because they find it uncomfortable. By breaking the steps up small enough right from the start to condition the leash pressure simply as a positive cue without conflict, physical or psychological intimidation, you can create the same wanted behavior in the dog ‚Äì that the dog moves toward you to release the pressure, without the unwanted negative emotional response and behavioral side effects that using punishment can cause.

SIfjRt_0jqU,Dog Training by Kikopup,Service Dog Training - Public Access Training Episode 2 - MASTERING Public Restrooms!,"Most dogs without any training can find public restrooms an unpleasant or even worrisome place to be. This video is created to help service dog teams MASTER Public Restrooms and the weird, creepy and loud noises that happen in them! Although this video is made for service dog teams, it is highly beneficial for pet dogs in order to teach them to be confident going places like groomers, vets as well as going in your own bathroom to be bathed.  

A wonderful thing about breaking the training up into small steps is that you see your dog make progress and you are building on frequent small successes which can be very reinforcing and motivating for the handler.

PEiACncIkVg,Dog Training by Kikopup,Service Dog Training - Public Access Training Tips - Episode 1,"This is the first video in a series of videos of training service dogs for public access. This video is for service dog teams working on teaching their dog to be calm, confident, reliable and safe in public spaces where dogs are allowed as well as where only service dogs are allowed. However, these tutorials and tips are great for everyone who wants a confident, well-behaved dog to bring places that pet dogs are allowed to go in public. In no way does this video condone training a fake service dog to bring places pet dogs are not allowed.  Instead, if you have a pet dog, the goal of this training is to be able to go places like parks, boardwalks, city streets, outdoor dog friendly cafes and restaurants and stores that do not sell food and have a policy where pet dogs are allowed to enter. Yes, Halo is my service dog, replacing Splash my 13 year old. I don‚Äôt usually like to talk about it publicly as it is a sensitive issue for me, however at this point in my life, I believe I can help so many people who rely on their service dogs as well as help service dogs feel more comfortable and confident in their everyday lives that I figured showing my personal training with Halo my new service dog was important. 

The topics covered in this episode are: Teaching your dog a calm greeting behavior, teaching your dog to be confident with unexpected and unwanted attention from humans, teaching your dog to wait patiently to get out of the vehicle and into the vehicle, as well as to teach your dog to wait calmly with you before you move away from your vehicle.  This video also briefly shows how you can use teaching a dog to stop on a default next to you when you stop to teach a dog to go up and down stairs without rushing ahead of you. 

The tutorials I mention in this video are:

This video is for both puppies and adult dogs.  I find by teaching this concept in puppy classes and beginning obedience classes it greatly helps the dog handlers to be able to train their dogs without the dogs getting as frustrated when criteria is raised when learning a new behavior, because what can happen is the dog might offer a couple of incorrect behaviors while learning something new that don‚Äôt get reinforced and the dog can power through the lesson because they already feel confident offering multiple behaviors on cue for reinforcement, so realize that reinforcement is still coming even when it doesn‚Äôt come after each attempt that they try.

Teaching your dog to be comfortable with having their teeth brushed can be easy with some dogs and take more time with others.  By taking the time to get your dog comfortable with it, it can save a lot of struggling down the road.  You can supply chews that can help clean the teeth but its still a good idea to check your dog‚Äôs teeth and brush them as chews don‚Äôt always clean all the surfaces of the teeth. 

The steps are broken up in this video so your dog can achieve a positive emotional response every step of the way.  Don‚Äôt worry if your dog at times decides it‚Äôs too much you can always end the session and then remember to keep sessions short and fun and warm up with easy exercises like just following the brush, doing some handling exercises or a chin rest.

7omuDOadL04,Dog Training by Kikopup,Stop Counter Surfing - Dog Training Games,"This video goes over exercises for teaching your dog to not take food from tables or counters or any situation you want to train such as supermarket shelves if you have a service dog.  This behavior is called a default behavior with a situational cue because the goal is to train the dog that the food on the counters is the cue to leave it, so you don‚Äôt have to be around to tell the dog leave it in the future. 

In between training the food on tables needs to be cleaned away so the dog doesn‚Äôt rehearse the undesirable behavior of taking the food from the table.  Some dogs are easier to train this than others and it is much easier to work on if the dog doesn‚Äôt already have a history of taking food off tables and counters so I suggest working on this with your new puppy or adult dog BEFORE the issue occurs and before you leave your dog to roam the house unattended when food is on the counters.

lLyiQODnR1s,Dog Training by Kikopup,Be CALM and LISTEN in NEW PLACES - for puppies and adult dogs,"How to teach a puppy or adult dog to be calmer and listen in new places.

This video goes over how to lower arousal and reduce stress for dogs and puppies when visiting new locations.  When a dog is stressed or over-excited it can make a dog unable to take food and less likely to be able to listen to cues.  So by teaching dogs to be calmer when out and about it makes training easier as well as makes listening to you more reliable.  This training will make it much easier to work on loose leash walking as a lot of the time dogs who have a hard time walking on a loose leash are pulling because they are over-aroused or stressed when in new environments.

_afpSZlHw5g,Dog Training by Kikopup,TROUBLESHOOTING for training a dog to DROP a TOY,"This video covers the solution to the problem that many have when working with food to train a dog to drop a toy.  That the dog becomes so interested in the food that they no longer want to play with the toy at all making it impossible to teach the behavior of ""Drop it"".  Emily shows how she breaks the training steps up into smaller approximations, starting with the food further away from her Chihuahua puppy Epic to begin with and how to build on successes. This step in training may seem tricky and easy to avoid by simply not having food around when you play with toys, but by doing the work to teach the dog that playing with the toy EARNS the treats as well, you will have a dog who can work for both food and toys and not get distracted by food when playing with a toy or working with you when someone else is eating food. 


This video is only on troubleshooting and does not cover the actual steps for training the behavior of DROP which is covered in the video below.


How to train Drop it using food: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc

0Ebe7mIzqFA,Dog Training by Kikopup,SIT and DOWN STAY - Tips for GETTING STARTED with a new puppy,"Sit and Down Stay - Tips for the first training session with your puppy
This video goes over tips for initially getting the puppy into the positions.  Also most dog training tutorials don‚Äôt really go into detail as to how to teach the puppy to follow the treat when getting into the position but then ignore the treat when it is moved away from them and they are expected to stay.  This video shows what you can do in the first training sessions to teach the concept of moving into the positions and staying there as the treat is then moved away. 

This is not a full tutorial on teaching a reliable stay, after following these initial steps, you will then need to add distance, distractions and duration to your training. 

Here are full tutorials on teaching stay:

If your puppy or adult dog just isn‚Äôt thinking to lay down when you move the treat you can try this technique of luring the puppy under a chair or your leg-

42OOTnTETNw,Dog Training by Kikopup,Teach your dog to SHAKE,"Teaching your dog to shake or in other works offer you his paw is not only a fun trick but also a great skill for grooming and husbandry.  For example, it can be used for nail trimming or examining the dog‚Äôs feet for burs. 

This is Epic the Chihuahua puppy‚Äôs first lesson at learning to shake.  As I describe in the video, I waited a month to train this trick because it‚Äôs not a great idea to train this as one of your new puppy or adult dog‚Äôs first behaviors.  This is because the dog does not yet know the concept of doing the behaviors only on cue yet.  

In this video I show many different ways to get your puppy initially thinking to use his paw if you have a dog or puppy who just doesn‚Äôt think to use his paw using the normal methods for teaching paw targeting.

VwOMIbtoWkk,Dog Training by Kikopup,STOP Leash Walking Problems BEFORE they Start,"Proactive leash training is training the loose leash walking skills in small achievable steps BEFORE they are needed, rather than problem solving as you go, which can end in a lot of rehearsal of unwanted behavior that can not only be stressful for the person but also for the dog.  When dogs pull on leash it is no fun for the owner, but the dog can also be feeling frustrated, stressed and confused.  So short fun training sessions in your house and yard will benefit not only the owner but also the dog. 

In this video I show how my puppy has such great success walking on a loose leash on her first walk because I did short fun proactive training sessions to teach her the skills of walking on leash while in my own home and yard where there were no distractions and the treats were reinforcing to her. 

This video goes over teaching the puppy to be comfortable having the harness put on, teaching the puppy to ignore the leash and not bite at it and teaching the leash pressure game:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUG_J7mIHvc

If you need more help with teaching leash walking skills to your dog than my free videos on youtube provide.  You can purchase my Leash Walking CONNECTED course.  In the 6 week Self-Study course, it goes over exercises to practice each week and how many times to practice:

sibw416B6wo,Dog Training by Kikopup,What I Trained my Puppy in the FIRST WEEK,"I‚Äôve been getting a lot of requests for a video of what I trained Epic in the first week. As I describe in the video what we train each puppy or new adult dog who is added to the family is very different depending on the dogs genetics, personality, what happened to them in the womb and the very important 8 first weeks of their life.  I describe what I worked on with my own puppy and then give insights about what generally is a good idea to focus on first with all puppies. 

My three main focuses training Epic the Chihuahua puppy were:
1 Building our relationship while training the attention game, attn. noise and recall with Positive Reinforcement

2 Separation training

3 Building her relationship with my other dogs and teaching them to act appropriately together

You can see my latest puppy Epic learning in her first lesson how to come when called. This video goes over how to initially condition the recall. I will then create another video on how to create reliability to the recall.

The key is making sure you have treats that are high enough value that your dog finds reinforcing.  If the dog has low interest or no interest in the treat, then the training will not be effective.  Here is a video about what treats to use: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P_MYUhd_BYIf your dog is not motivated by food here is a video that goes over that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knYNa0U5QZU

xZbeFrr9hyg,Dog Training by Kikopup,Learn about Dog Play from Expert Mara Velez,"On Dog Play! Along with posting my own tutorials on this channel I am hosting trainers I admire who are experts in their field. Today I would like to introduce you to Mara Velez who is a trainer I admire and an expert in dog play. Today she will be discussing what appropriate dog play looks like, what inappropriate play looks like and then will show demos of the process of introducing dogs and how to assess interactions.  This is just a brief introduction. Check out the website of Shelter Playgroup Alliance for a wealth of information on dog play:


https://www.shelterdogplay.org/


This video goes over how you can set up dogs who are friendly and social with other dogs for successful introductions and appropriate play. If you have a dog who can behave fearful, reactive or your dog hasn‚Äôt been around other dogs or you just don‚Äôt know what your dog might do, I suggest getting help from a professional trainer who uses positive reinforcement to help you with a training plan for your specific dog.  


ABOUT THE TRAINER:

Mara Velez, Executive Director, MA, CPDT-KA

Mara Velez is the Executive Director of the Shelter Playgroup Alliance and a Certified Professional Dog Trainer.  Prior to co-founding the Shelter Playgroup Alliance, Mara was a behavior and training consultant for several years at Contra Costa Animal Services (CCASD), an open-admission county shelter.  At CCASD she collaboratively designed, developed, and implemented behavior program structures, including a robust volunteer training program, the behavior evaluation, and  the canine enrichment and playgroup guidelines.

In addition to working with canines, Mara enjoys training  other species because it expands her training and observation skills. She has worked with cats, rabbits, wolves, foxes, guinea pigs, coyotes, buffalo, donkeys, goats, alpacas, chickens, parrots, corvids and other birds, and a fish.


Mara holds both a bachelors and masters degree in psychology and completed all of the course work for a doctorate in education.  She also completed University of the Pacific Animal Shelter Management Program and the Summer Shelter Institute. Mara has also completed KPA, LLA, and several other animal behavior and training-related programs.

5e_gVqJkdek,Dog Training by Kikopup,The Attention Noise - Puppy Training,"This video tutorial goes over how to train an attention noise to a puppy as well as an adult dog.  After training the attention noise can be used to ask your dog for attention but also to interrupt behaviors you don‚Äôt like.  When your dog is doing something you don‚Äôt like, for example chewing on a shoe, you can use the attention noise to get your dog‚Äôs attention and then show him what he should be chewing on, his own dog bones.  


If you just got a new puppy or adult dog I suggest first playing the ""Attention Game"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiziN7mluz8  To get the ball rolling for this exercise that is a little harder. 


This behavior is also known as watch me, focus, the attention noise, and the positive interrupter.

NUG_J7mIHvc,Dog Training by Kikopup,What to do FIRST - Getting Started with Leash Training,"This video shows me getting my latest puppy Epic comfortable and well mannered wearing a harness and leash. Without prior training and just putting on a harness and leash and ""seeing what happens"" usually ends in something the handler won't like.  Some things that could happen is that the dog could have an immediate negative experience to wearing the gear, backing away from it or perhaps biting at the harness and leash and that can turn into a habit.  The best solution is proactive behavior management. Show the puppy what TO do.  Reinforce what you want FIRST to get the ball rolling than take the risk of one trial learning where the puppy finds out he loves playing tug with his leash and your pant legs when you go for a walk.  Letting an animal rehearse a behavior makes it more likely to happen than if the animal was set up to never think about doing the behavior at all.

3XUaef63Fd4,Dog Training by Kikopup,Loose Leash Walking TIPS,"This video talks about what exercises to work on when your dog suddenly starts to pull again on leash.  It also goes over the concept of training your dog to stop when you stop on a walk and how that can build your dog‚Äôs attention on your movement.  I also show doing the exercise when walking multiple dogs.  I have 5 dogs, that I sometimes walk in a big group, however I also give the dogs separate walks and one on one time with me where I can follow the dogs and let them choose where to go.  It is not necessary to teach a dog to walk at your side if you live in the county your dog could be off leash on all walks, however I suggest still training it for those times where you might need to go to a vet or you are traveling and visiting a busy city.  

If you do live in a city, you can have your dog walk next to you when passing by lots of people in a busy street, and then make sure you find areas along the way where you can invite your dog to ‚Äúgo sniff‚Äù and let him explore the environment and make choices about which direction to go in as you follow behind.

6uTgSr0acBo,Dog Training by Kikopup,How is it possible to use Positive Reinforcement to train a RELIABLE recall?,"This video goes over the concept of how it is possible to train come when called using Positive Reinforcement.  The key is proactive training and behavior modification where you set up training sessions so the dog can succeed step by step as criteria is raised.  I talk about how it‚Äôs not so much about proofing a recall with things that make your dog excited as much as taking the time to teach your dog to be calm confident and have self-control around the things that make him excited.  When you achieve that you can imagine that a recall is really easy for a dog to do in that situation. I use the example of wildlife in this video but the same holds true for anything that excites your dog.  I then talk about how beneficial it is to teach your dog the concept that access to the environment and what he wants to do most is contingent on listening to you so that your dog isn‚Äôt feeling punished when being recalled to you when what he was doing was more reinforcing than what you have on your person. 



As you know I don't usually show ""before"" footage of dogs because the best plan is to never let the behavior be rehearsed again so the dog will be less likely to do it in the future. But in this case it was a unexpected reaction to prey that by chance was captured on camera. This was the first and last time Tug was in this state because I managed the environment after finding out how excited he was about prey. This footage of Tug is from my Harnessing the Hunter Video on Demand.  Tug was an easy fix just by chance because of his personality and genetics but in the video on demand I go over the process of training how to teach dogs bred for hunting or who have chased prey already to listen around prey. https://dogmantics.com/product/harnessing-the-hunter-vod/

Thank you Lili for putting so much time, skill and love into this book! It‚Äôs greatly appreciated by all of us whose life work is to better the lives and relationships of people and their dogs.

PLuKnrVYmQs,Dog Training by Kikopup,LEAVE IT from TRASH and FOOD on WALKS,"Teach your puppy or adult dog to not pick up trash or food when out on a walk on or off leash.  The key to successful training is to do training set ups rather than try to train your dog only in real life when he encounters something. This is because if the dog has already gone over to whatever it is in the environment and or even started to pick it up and eat it and you call your dog away or say leave it, the behavior of searching for the item or even picking it up can be inadvertently reinforced meaning that your dog might continue to search for trash.  In this video I show how you can set up training set ups in which you control the environment and can set the dog up to do understand that food on the ground is a situational cue to leave it alone.  The great thing about this method is that you can teach the dog to completely ignore whatever it is rather than be told to leave it AFTER investigating whatever it is.  Proactive behavior management such as working on the issue BEFORE your puppy starts to do it means saving lots of time training down the line.  One of the wonderful things about using positive reinforcement to train is that usually the one exercise has multiple benefits, such as this exercise can help teach dogs impulse control and reduce leash pulling drastically.

AoM9tis3t2c,Dog Training by Kikopup,Handling and Grooming for PUPPIES - Step by Step Guide,"This video goes over all the steps to teaching a puppy to be relaxed and confident with handling and grooming.  This video is not for adult dogs as with adult dogs different steps are needed to create a safe and fun training environment.  Here is a link to grooming training tips for dogs of all ages: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCJ0wh5cxi4

Here are the steps I will be covering in this video: 

Puppy Handling Protocol

Step 1 Touch and feed a treat at the same time
Step 2 Touch your puppy, say ‚ÄúGood‚Äù or click and then move to feed a treat
Step 3 Add duration to the handling and teach the puppy to ignore the treats
Step 4 Keep changing the picture


Puppy Grooming Protocol

Step 1 Condition a positive emotional response to the grooming tools using training games that don‚Äôt involve grooming
‚Ä¢ Grooming tool recall game
‚Ä¢ Play training games where the tools are present
Step 2 Practice the handling that will be necessary during grooming before incorporating the tools 
Step 3 Touch with the grooming tool and feed a treat at the same time 
Step 4 Touch your puppy with the tool, say ‚ÄúGood‚Äù or click and then move to feed a treat
Step 5 Increase difficulty and duration in small approximations
Step 6 Keep changing the picture

Helpful behaviors to work on to aide with handling and grooming:

‚Ä¢ Take treats nicely  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8
‚Ä¢ Default leave it from treat container https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Re66qOiso28
‚Ä¢ Sit, stand or settle calmly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr1olzgidMw
‚Ä¢ Go to a mat or platform https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2c5EkytNU0
‚Ä¢ Targeting behaviors such as the chin rest and paw targeting https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9tOdmJLVl0
‚Ä¢ Eye contact  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4ASIKw-urY
‚Ä¢ Relationship building games like the attention game https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiziN7mluz8

If the puppy shows any signs of discomfort or dislike during either the handling or the grooming go back to a step to where the puppy is comfortable or work on some behaviors your puppy loves doing to take a break.  All puppies are different but some common signs of discomfort are turning the head away, looking away, holding ears lower or back, licking the lips, ducking, lowering the body, withdrawing paw, backing away, putting the tail lower, tension in the body and arching the back.

Don‚Äôt panic if you see your dog offering these signs as you raise criteria, as sometimes they are unavoidable.  The signals are just information to the trainer to break the steps up smaller or add variety to the training.  For example if the dog‚Äôs toes are repeatedly being restrained in the training session it can cause the dog to find it an unpleasant experience even when getting a treat every time.  So instead you can sometimes ask for high five, as well as sometimes just stroke the paw, sometimes lift it up and down and only 1 out of five to ten times restrain and hold the paw. 

If the puppy needs to be groomed before the training is complete, choose a moment when the puppy is calm and let the puppy chew on a high value chew as you work.  This is easier if you have a helper.  It might be necessary to only do a portion of the grooming at a time, for example just one or two nails or brush just one part of the puppy to keep the puppy from having a negative experience. 

Dogs can sometimes feel physical discomfort during grooming or veterinary care, for example if hair gets pulled, a nail bed is sore, the dog gets pushed off balance, the dog has pain in his body or a needle is used.  A technique I learned from Ken Ramirez is to vary the training that is involved for procedures that can be uncomfortable for the animal. You can do this by teaching a puppy that something novel will happen during the grooming and handling procedures.  To do this practice stroking, scratching, brushing, gentle poking and on the rare occasion a giving rabies shot or having to use a thermometer, rather than simply repeating something physically uncomfortable. Varying what you do will make it less likely for setbacks when something unexpected happens. 

Check to see if your puppy is a willing participant by moving away from him or tossing a treat further away from you.  If he is reluctant to move toward you after eating the treat it means you need to change your training plan.

wI-ZCEKgsfE,Dog Training by Kikopup,Teach a Little Dog or Puppy to Travel in a Carrier,"This video is on the topic of teaching your puppy or small dog to relax and lay down inside a kennel or doggie back pack while being carried around.  This is beneficial for many reasons.  It's a great way to bring your puppy places, like the vet, that he might not be able to be put down on the ground until he has gotten all his shots.  It is great also for toy dogs and puppies to be able to go on a walk where they might tire before another dog does or their guardian does.  My little Chihuahua Kiko who is 16, just can't keep up on walks so I let her walk some of the way and the rest of the way she rides in a backpack while the other dogs get to hike the trail and get the exercise they need.

It's important that the dog already knows how to sit, stand and down without moving their feet before working on the position changes. 



It's important to seek the advice of a physical therapist if your dog finds any position or movement hard to achieve.

Re66qOiso28,Dog Training by Kikopup,Leave It   *NEW version by KIKOPUP*,"How to teach a puppy or adult dog the leave it cue using Positive Reinforcement. 
Below are the 4 Steps that are covered in the video. 

Step 1

Put extremely low value food down on the ground.  Move far enough away that your dog can easily look away from the food and back at you. Mark and feed your dog for choosing to look away from the food.  If your dog doesn't think to look away from the food on his own you can use an attention noise.  If he still can't look away from it, it means the distraction is too hard. If this happens use a lower value distraction or create distance from the distraction. When your dog looks away from the distraction you can mark and reinforce multiple times.  This will make it less likely for the dog to feel like he needs to keep looking at the distraction and will make it easier to add duration to the leave it cue.  

Step 2

Change things up.  Move the location of the distraction, use a different distraction and approach and pass it from different angles.

Step 3 Add the cue

Once your dog is looking away from the distraction within 3 seconds you can add your cue.  Move the distraction or change your location to get the dog to notice the distraction again. Then say your cue 'leave it'. Mark and reinforce your dog for turning back toward you.
If the dog doesn't look away from the distraction, stop saying your cue until the behavior is reliably happening within 3 seconds. This will help create a cue that the dog responds to promptly after you say it.

Step 4 

Continue to generalize the behavior and add criteria.

If the dog goes for the distraction more than 3 times in a row it means the criteria is too high and the training will not be as affective as if you break up the steps into smaller approximations, such as working from further away or using an easier distraction.  When the dog is off leash for the first time, go back to using the easiest distraction.

You could allow the dog to get the distraction on a release cue such as ""Get it"", however if you do this it can lead to the dog anticipating being released as well as getting more excited during the training process because of the fast movement of going for the food.  I suggest not to do this during initial training.  If you want to give the dog the distraction, pick it up and hand it to him.

Some ideas for generalizing the behavior:

Turn away from the distraction and come back to you
Walk past the distraction with you
Walk around the distraction with you
Call the dog past the distraction to you

OsqC9hbefig,Dog Training by Kikopup,WHEN and HOW to STOP CLICKING,"How and when to stop clicking when clicker training with your puppy or adult dog.  If you are too predictable and stay at the same level of criteria for too long, it can be confusing and frustrating for dogs when you suddenly stop clicking.  This video explains when to stop clicking and how to do it in a way that won't cause frustration or cause your dog to start making errors in training.  The more training you do with your dog the more your dog will understand the way you train and training concepts.  The more behaviors you transfer onto just a verbal cue or hand signal the more the dog will understand the concept of how you train news cues.  The same holds true for the process of no longer clicking behaviors the dog is offering reliably on cue.

iKG89GVOJiM,Dog Training by Kikopup,The Leash Pressure Game FOR PUPPIES! - to STOP PULLING on leash,"Is your puppy pulling? Teach the Leash Pressure GAME! 
If there were one exercise I think every puppy and dog should learn if they have to abide by leash laws, it is this one.  If you want to know why some people struggle with a dog who pulls on leash, besides the issue of over-arousal, it is because they haven‚Äôt yet trained and proofed this behavior. 

The giving into leash pressure game teaches your puppy what to do when he hits the end of the leash, which is to turn around and come back to you.  By training and conditioning leash pressure in small enough approximations it is possible to turn what is usually a frustrating and aversive experience into a cue that has a positive association to the dog that simply means ‚Äúmove with me‚Äù.  A lot of people believe certain stimuli are ‚Äúintrinsically‚Äù reinforcing or punishing.  But this is simply untrue.  It is possible through training and conditioning to change an animal‚Äôs emotional response to a certain stimuli.  Instead of just relying on habituation, where dogs learn over repetition that being moved by you on leash isn‚Äôt terrible I suggest playing these training games to make it an experience where the dog doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs some sort of intimidation game.  I also suggest doing the same with teaching a dog to be picked up as well as handled and groomed.  

A lot of trainers use something called pressure and release, which basically the reinforcer for the animal is to avoid the feeling of the pressure because they find it uncomfortable.  By breaking the steps up small enough right from the start to condition the leash pressure simply as a positive cue without conflict, physical or psychological intimidation, you can create the same wanted behavior in the dog ‚Äì that the dog moves toward you to release the pressure, without the unwanted negative emotional response and behavioral side effects that using punishment can cause. 

Video tutorials mentioned:

Attention Game- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiziN7mluz8
Recall- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjd99MlmqqI
Leash walking reinforcing for standing next to you - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voW2Vkq0u6Q
Direction changes-  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-L2qtD7MQ


Step 1 
Add light pressure on the leash as you lure your puppy forward and then feed a treat.

Step 2 
Put a distraction down on the ground that makes the puppy pull on leash.  Use your attention noise or treat lure to get your puppy to turn around and come back to you.
2 Use a lower value treat as the distraction and a higher value treat as the reinforcer.

Step 3 
Put a distraction down on the ground that makes the puppy pull on leash.  When the puppy is on a tight leash, move in the opposite direction of the puppy without jerking him.  Mark and reinforce when you see your puppy turn in your direction. If the puppy doesn't turn toward you within 2 seconds, use your attention noise or treat lure to get your puppy to turn around and come back to you.
Step 4 
Practice with different distractions in different situations

What to do if your puppy doesn't turn around:
1 Practice from further away from the distraction (You can have a helper put down the distraction to make this easier.) 


If you're doing the exercise correctly, you will find that your puppy will stop pulling all together. This is a good thing! If he keeps trying to go for the distraction it means the distraction is too difficult, too close or you need to spend more time marking and reinforcing him for staying with you after he comes back. In real life situations if your puppy starts pulling on leash you can simply back up until he is on a loose leash then wait a little bit until you have made a connection with him again before walking forward.

0hcRZEYSARs,Dog Training by Kikopup,Game to Teach the CONCEPT of STAY - Dog Training,"A game to teach the concept of stay until the release cue is given.

This game is for those of you who ask their dog to sit stay and then after a few seconds the dog seems confused and either gets up or starts offering other behaviors he thinks might work.  Often times dogs get up from a stay position because they do not quite yet grasp the concept that they should remain in position until they hear the release cue.  Sometimes the learner can interpret no information as being wrong and so will start to change their behavior to see what might work.  This very simple game teaches dogs the concept of waiting until the release is given.  

If the dog is too excited by the food on the plate, you can use lower value treats on the plate and higher value treats that you give to the dog for waiting to be released. 

You can also practice this game using toys as the reinforcer that the dog is released to. 

I don‚Äôt suggest playing this game with your dog‚Äôs dinner as it can cause your dog to eat faster than he normally would if the bowl was calmly put down in front of him while he was relaxed.  Also the reason this game works, is because the dog is getting a high level of reinforcement while waiting to be released.  If you just put something down and the dog only gets reinforced when he gets up to get it, as you can imagine it can cause the dog to get excited or over-aroused while waiting to finally be released.

G0Z3SFT8U0g,Dog Training by Kikopup,Down Stay with TOY DISTRACTIONS,"How to teach your puppy or adult dog to STAY with the distraction of TOYS!  Starring my puppy Halo the Border Collie.  This puppy has not worked on this exercise before filming this video.  The reason the puppy looks ‚Äúalready trained‚Äù is because the training is broken up into small easily achievable steps so the dog makes few to no errors during the training process.  By setting the training plan up so the dog can succeed at every step leaves little to no room for confusion or frustration.  If your dog gets confused more than 3 times in a row, it means that the training criteria is too high and you need to lower criteria for the dog to be successful.  I believe by breaking the steps up smaller to begin with, you actually save time in training and can advance to more complex behaviors and higher levels of criteria faster because you have build a strong solid foundation on the basic aspects of the behavior with a high level of reinforcement for the correct behaviors with little to no variation. 

Here are the Prerequisites:

1 You have already worked on the cue to lay down and release cue and your puppy or adult dog can stay in the position for 20-30 seconds with no distractions. 


2 For the down stay teaching the settle as well as calmness around food can also speed up the training process.

4 If you are going to move away from your dog with the dog, you first need to proof your own movement away from your dog with no toy before adding the difficulty of the toy.  With my own puppy I practiced moving away as well as proofing the stay with FOOD distractions, see these videos:

In the video I play Volkswagen's ""The Bark Side"" video in order to use it to train dogs not to bark as a fun challenge.  Here is the video to use with your own dogs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aW3dtNhLUo

Article on barking at noises: https://dogmantics.com/solving-barking-at-noises/

This video is a remake of one I made in 2019 but I added video examples of the training.  This video addresses the issue of barking at noises while in a house or apartment when the owner is home as well as absent. Dogs bark for many reasons. We can assume that dogs are barking at noises they hear outside the house because they are either startled, aroused or worried about the noise. There could also be the aspect of communicating to the other dogs and family members that they have heard a noise, which no doubt we selected dogs to do for thousands of years. Barking can cause problems for us humans, like getting an angry note from the landlord. It can also cause problems for your dog. Worrying or being excited about what is outside while inside can mean that your dog will not be getting as much sleep and this can even cause chronic stress. Reacting to noises while at home is usually one of the root causes of other behavioral problems that show little or no improvement no matter how much time is spent with a behavior modification plan. For example, if you train your dog 100% of the time while on a walk around your neighborhood not to react to people or dogs, but then while you are at work an he reacts to the sounds of the people and dogs outside, it will prevent your training from progressing. 

If your dog is reactive or aggressive to people or dogs it‚Äôs important to seek the help of a veterinary behaviorist or trainer who doesn‚Äôt use physical or psychological intimidation to solve the issues.  I suggest looking at the PGG trainer search or the IAABC trainer search.

I hope this video will inspire service dog teams to work on their dogs skills while sheltering in place in their homes.  These exercises are specifically for teaching the dog to walk near the handler even when there are obstacles, a shopping cart ahead and distractions.  Even if there wasn‚Äôt a coronavirus outbreak I still believe it‚Äôs a great idea with ANY dog to proof the behaviors you are going to ask your dog to perform in public in your home.

Everyone knows that you can't change your dog's behavior without changing your own behavior and the same is true in this situation of the coronavirus.  Each and every one of us can change our own behavior and our behavior change affects the future for the better! This is extremely empowering! 



In the video I talk about social distancing but it is also really important to wash your hands properly and frequently as well as not touch your face until you've washed your hands.  Some other ideas if you are living with someone who is elderly or has a compromised immune system is leaving your shoes outside in a tray, showering when you get home, put your clothes immediately into the washing machine and sanitizing your wallet, phone and keys.

THE GROOMING RECALL GAME - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiziN7mluz8  The KEY to this training game is your MOVEMENT.  If you think your puppy or adult dog won‚Äôt move to you when you move away from him.  I suggest first playing this game in multiple training sessions until you have a dog who you can‚Äôt get away from. This is the first game I would play with nearly every new puppy or new adult dog. 

Often times dogs can be startled by the sight and sound of grooming equipment at first. So instead of jumping right to the step of using the tools, you can condition your dog to find the sight and sound of the tools a positive experience.

The way this video approaches puppy socialization is setting up the environment for success to reinforce the social behaviors you want while creating a positive emotional response. Approaching puppy socialization as if training a behavior. Breaking the training up into steps.  The puppy‚Äôs prior history and genetics will determine how fast you move through the steps.

About the author:


Emily Larlham runs the dog training business Dogmantics Dog Training in San Diego, California.  She is known around the world for her popular Youtube Channel ‚ÄòKikopup‚Äô where she has posted over 350 free in-depth dog training tutorials. She believes that by putting out free training tutorials that don‚Äôt involve any forms of physical or psychological intimidation, it will not only effect how people treat animals but also how people treat other human beings. Emily created the term ‚ÄòProgressive Reinforcement Training‚Äô and a training manifesto to describe this way of training in detail.

Emily began her training career as an animal care-giver in a shelter about 15 years ago where she met her dog training mentor Kyle Rayon. After meeting Kyle, Emily quit her job and became an apprentice. After many years of study, learning from both human and thousands of canine mentors, she began her own business. She combines her artistic background and training skills to invent creative, fast and reliable ways to solve problem behaviors as well as train complex behaviors and tricks. She has been invited to conduct seminars on her techniques for training dogs without intimidation in North and South America, Europe, Africa, Australia and Asia. She has also spoken at conferences such as the PPG Summit, Clicker Expo, Clicker Expo Europe, APDT Australia and the Art and Science of Animal Training Conference.","['puppy training', 'dog training', 'what to train first', 'dog training tutorials', 'puppy training video', 'puppy training course', 'kikopup', 'emily larlham', 'dogmantics', 'puppy training 101', 'puppy training basics', 'professional dog training', 'puppy training no biting', 'stop puppy biting', 'puppy barking', 'obedience', 'best dog trainer', 'youtube dog trainer', 'puppy training come', 'teach your puppy to listen', 'shy puppy', 'online puppy training', 'puppy training online', 'how to train a puppy']",2020-01-21T18:32:37Z,PT2H59M42S,hd,false,2758667,18931,0,663

71T6K9IU9P0,Dog Training by Kikopup,Why newbies FAIL using TREATS and TOYS to TRAIN DOGS,"This video goes over one reason why newbie owners and newbie dog trainers FAIL when attempting to get their dogs to work for toys and treats as well as to get their dogs to like something like nail clippers, guests visiting the house or other dogs.  This video is all about understanding the importance of the trainer‚Äôs MOVEMENT when training, and how it can make or break your training.  A trainer could write the most amazing training plan which looks amazing on paper, but the way the trainer MOVES during the training could totally make or break the training depending on the dog.  

All dogs have different personalities, so some dogs are not as affected by movement as others.  But it is extremely important to learn to read your dog‚Äôs body language to see if your movement affects your dog. 

This video also really is a great example of how you can turn a punisher into a reinforcer and turn a reinforcer into a punisher.  This is why it‚Äôs extremely important to understand that you can‚Äôt just label things as being intrinsically reinforcing or intrinsically punishing to dogs.  Everything is subjective and fluid.  Only the dogs brain decides what is reinforcing and what is punishing, not the trainer. 

Halo the Border Collie is just 9 months old in this video and the goal with him is to condition him to think anything I do with him is reinforcing.  If you see something makes your dog feel uncomfortable you can train them in training sessions to be confident instead of worried to create a resilient learner. 

I show myself working with a dog who is shy and reserved with guests in this video as well as describe how I worked with my own dog‚Äôs fear of a hand reaching at him.  This is in no way advice for training your own dog.  If you have a dog who is acting shy, reactive or aggressive toward people you need to go and hire a professional dog trainer who doesn‚Äôt use any forms of physical or psychological intimidation to help you with setting up a training plan, because even if you try to follow what I did in the video, you might raise criteria too fast and that can cause the dog‚Äôs behavior to get worse rather than better.  As well as you might not be able to read your dog‚Äôs body language that it is time to raise or lower criteria.

This video also touches on how too much stess and other behavioral issues can be the cause for some dogs behavioral issues, and how it is important to look at the dogs full history before creating a training plan.  I will create more how to videos on this subject.  I did not touch on the topic of how genetics and personality can also be the reason behind dog's fearful or aggressive behavior but will at a later date. 



I used the term Positive Methods to mean training without the intentional use of physical or psychological intimidation.  A type of training called Progressive Reinforcement Training.  You can find out more about it here: https://progressivereinforcementtraining.com/

p_5jkgmyurI,Dog Training by Kikopup,"Positive Reinforcement didn't work"" - WHY this happens","People frequently say ""Positive Reinforcement Didn't Work"".  I am going to explain why this happens as well as talk about the concept that Positive Reinforcement wasn't actually used. I will talk briefly about situations to avoid in which food, toys and access to the environment do not function as reinforcers that can efficiently change behavior. 

The main take away from this video is that just because you are giving the dog food, toys or access to something, it does not necessarily mean that you are using Positive Reinforcement  Reinforcers and Punishers are subjective and can change depending on the situation.  They mirror each other in how they can be conditioned and you can change a reinforcer into a punisher and a punisher into a reinforcer.  The key to effective training using Positive Reinforcement is knowing how to break the steps up, arrange the environment, raise criteria and condition and use reinforcers effectively. Its also extremely important to be able to read your dog's body language and behavior to know the strength of the reinforcer as well as when the criteria is too low or too high or the dog is acting over-aroused, fearful or anxious.

This video goes over how to train your dog to stop jumping by training the dog what you DO want him to do instead of jumping.  Dogs and puppies naturally want to jump up on people for many reasons.  This video covers how to condition your dog to be calm and offer a trained greeting behavior to the most common triggers that elicit jumping - the guests movement, eye contact, touch and voice.

ZogNFdSBlzw,Dog Training by Kikopup,The FASTEST and EASIEST way to teach a PUPPY FETCH,"The FASTEST way to teach fetch to a puppy

This video goes over a very simple way that you can teach young puppies to fetch in one training session.  This technique does not work for all puppies.  Also as puppies get older they tend to want to drop the toy as they move toward you, so I suggest playing this game as one of the first games you play with your puppy.  I also suggest first playing the attention game with your puppy to make sure your puppy will move toward you when you entice him. 

Here is the video tutorial on how to train the attention game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiziN7mluz8

Here is a more detailed video on how to teach fetch if this technique does not work for your puppy.  However I suggest first trying the easy technique first before trying this one: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nm4goEuBt4

Puppy safety, a very important video to watch if you have a new puppy:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaNFY7jO6h4

The game plan:

Get two toys that look similar.  Get the puppy interested in one toy, then throw it.  Once the puppy has the toy in his mouth make an enticing noise and move backward as well if the puppy does not think to come right up to you.  

When the puppy gets to you, you can then either play tug with the toy he has or start to move the second toy around.  Once the puppy drops the toy in his mouth to pursue the one in your hand, throw it and repeat the game.  If you choose to play tug with the toy the puppy has when he gets back to you, hold the toy still and make the other one move to get him to drop it.  If this doesn‚Äôt work you can let go of the toy you are tugging with and move away from your puppy with the other toy enticing him to follow you and drop the toy he has. 

If you think that the puppy might bite your hands while you move the toy around, you can use a larger longer toy so you can keep your hands away from the sharp needle puppy teeth. 

Here is a video on how to teach the cue ‚Äúdrop it‚Äù: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvkyAFi7tc

If you throw the toy too far the puppy might not want to get it.  If this happens make sure not to throw it too far. 

Play this game for an extremely short period of time, to prevent the puppy getting disinterested and to prevent repetition of movement.  So perhaps 3-5 fetched items thrown at a distance that your puppy doesn‚Äôt built up speed to fetch.  Make sure to train on a non-slip surface as mentioned in the video.  Fetch can be a very jolting movement, so it‚Äôs important to greatly limit this game with your puppy until he reaches adulthood. You can train fetch with your puppy a few repetitions a day for a few days to teach him the behavior so when he has your socks you can get him to bring them to you.  Then you can set up the game so your puppy isn‚Äôt building up speed before he gets the toy to bring back to you.  Using fetch as a means for exercise is not a good idea as it can be too taxing for a young puppies body and can quite commonly lead to injury.  It can also lead to injury in adult dogs. Great ways to get around injury is making fetch a calmer behavior, so the puppy it moving at a trot toward the toy or that the toy has been thrown close enough that the puppy doesn‚Äôt build up speed.  A game I like to play with my own puppies is to give them the toy or tug on the toy with them and then let go and run backward to work on the concept of fetch without there being any fast repetitive jolting movements involved.  Take care also when playing tug that you are tugging very gently and limiting the amount of tugging especially if you have an enthusiastic tugger.

-tQrefk0Wyc,Dog Training by Kikopup,FIRST TRAINING GAME for grooming and nail trimming,"How to introduce your new puppy or adult dog to grooming equipment.  Often times dogs can be startled by the sight and sound of grooming equipment at first. So instead of jumping right to the step of using the tools, you can condition your dog to find the sight and sound of the tools a positive experience.  I use a game I call the ‚Äúgrooming recall game‚Äù.  The end result is that when you get the grooming equipment out the dog wants to move toward you and the equipment. 

The KEY to this training game is your MOVEMENT.  If you think your puppy or adult dog won‚Äôt move to you when you move away from him.  I suggest first playing this game in multiple training sessions until you have a dog who you can‚Äôt get away from.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiziN7mluz8  This is the first game I would play with nearly every new puppy or new adult dog.

HWT9DI7hMfo,Dog Training by Kikopup,Separation Training for Puppies and Adult Dogs,"This tutorial is on separation training or in other words teaching your dog to feel calm and relaxed when left home alone.  The way I approach separation training for dogs and puppies is setting the dog up for success by training him what I do want him to do and how I do want him to feel and leaving little room for error. 

It really depends on the puppy or dog and their previous training and experiences as to how fast you can progress through the steps as well as how quickly you can add duration.  With my own puppy Halo the breeder had already worked with Separation from people and dogs before I got him, so I could on day one already give him alone time a few times a day when he was feeling like a nap.  Tug my terrier came to me with separation anxiety, where I could not leave him alone at all. So for a month I build up the amount of time he could be left slowly and carefully to the point where I could leave for a couple of hours.  By working on the settle you can tell when criteria is too high because the dog do will get up to follow you or get up and approach the barrier they are behind.  It is a good visual signal for someone who is not good at reading dog body language to lower criteria without a set back in training.

Emily Larlham answers this burning question and shows a video example of how a dog can differentiate between food that is not to be touched in the environment and the treats he is being trained with. Emily talks briefly on how she trains a default leave it from food in the environment and how the best way to work on the issue of scavenging for food in the environment is setting up training sessions where you place the food and know where it is rather than trying to train your dog after they have found something on a walk.

gZ0XEr4DGfs,Dog Training by Kikopup,Housetraining 101,"This video is on housetraining puppies and dogs.  It covers teaching a dog where you want him to go to the bathroom, how to teach a cue to go to the bathroom, managing the dog in the house, what to do if your dog goes to the toilet in the house,  pros and cons of using a litter box for separation training, how to set up a pen with a litter box, setting up a pen or litter box for a dog who is peeing and pooping everywhere.

Housetraining consists of essentially 2 things: 

1 Teaching the puppy where to go
2 Management and prevention

Tips- If your puppy does pee in the house, hang out in area that was peed on, train and play with your puppy on that spot after it has been cleaned and dried, put a bed over it (if your puppy doesn‚Äôt like to pee in his bed) or a food or water bowl there telling them this is not a toilet! It‚Äôs the den! 

When the puppy has a FULL bladder, have them on leash in the area that they are prone to want to go in the house and say ‚Äúoutside‚Äù and show him the route to the RIGHT location. Some dogs just don‚Äôt seem to get that when they are upstairs they should go all the way down the stairs to out the door. By showing him the way, he will be more likely to think of it on his own.

Some puppies need to pee twice in a row. So if you are blessed with a puppy like this, you must praise and reward for going to the bathroom and then wait another minute.  With a previous puppy  I helped raise, we would walk him to one area in the yard where he would pee, then walk him to a second area where he would pee again 30 seconds later.

Some people find that bringing the puppy in and then going directly out again if a puppy is taking forever to go to the bathroom can speed up the process if you have a puppy that won‚Äôt go outside, but immediately wants to go when inside the house again.

Litter box training:

The key is taking the dog out so frequently and strategically that they don‚Äôt even go in their litter. Once the dog is reliably not going in the box the box can be removed. But it‚Äôs nice I think to have it for times where you are gone longer than normal or when say the dog might end up having a bladder infection.

IoN1dwALe6U,Dog Training by Kikopup,Introducing a NEW DOG to your dog,"This video covers how to introduce a new puppy or adult dog to your other dog or dogs in your household.  It covers techniques to use for dogs who do have issues with meeting other dogs and are not happy go lucky easy dogs. 

Unless you have an extremely calm, social and confident dog, when first meeting another dog, especially in a situation that he is not used to, it can cause him to feel stressed and excited.  This excitement can sometimes cause a dog to over react or act unpredictably.  So the safest method for preventing the dogs from having a negative experience during their first encounters is to break up the steps so the dogs feel safe and confident every step of the way.    

 Having the dogs settle first at a distance and then closer together is a great way to reinforce the dogs for being calm in each other‚Äôs presence.  What can happen if you have a puppy whose first experiences are with playing with the other dog when meeting, it can be harder to teach the puppy that the sight of the other dog isn‚Äôt the invitation to play and bother that dog.

CIV2lai2RJ4,Dog Training by Kikopup,STOP Barking at Noises,"Please watch the latest version of this video here :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhc2jlc6dmc



This video addresses the issue of barking at noises while in a house or apartment when the owner is home as well as absent. Dogs bark for many reasons. We can assume that dogs are barking at noises they hear outside the house because they are either startled, aroused or worried about the noise. There could also be the aspect of communicating to the other dogs and family members that they have heard a noise, which no doubt we selected dogs to do for thousands of years.
Barking can cause problems for us humans, like getting an angry note from the landlord. It can also cause problems for your dog. Worrying or being excited about what is outside while inside can mean that your dog will not be getting as much sleep and this can even cause chronic stress. Reacting to noises while at home is usually one of the root causes of other behavioral problems that show little or no improvement no matter how much time is spent with a behavior modification plan. For example, if you train your dog 100% of the time while on a walk around your neighborhood not to react to people or dogs, but then while you are at work an he reacts to the sounds of the people and dogs outside, it will prevent your training from progressing.

Have you ever been walking your dog and another dog runs at your dog and the owner yells ""It's OK! He's friendly!"" and then your dog either acts fearfully or lunges and barks at the approaching dog?  People often believe that THEIR dog is the dog with behavioral issues as they did not see the approaching dog growl, bark or snap at their dog.  However, in this video I will discuss how the ""friendly"" dog's behavior is actually not perceived as friendly behavior at all by other dogs, even though there is no biting, snapping, snarling, growling or barking.

This tutorial shows how you can break the steps up small enough to condition a positive emotional response towards working with another dog.  When you try to skip steps when teaching dogs to work together, what can happen is the dog can feel stressed or conflicted and can start showing signs of frustration or over excitement like whining and barking while working or signs of discomfort such as the dog putting his ears back when performing the behavior and showing other stress signals.

PwLfbkc8N24,Dog Training by Kikopup,STOP puppy BITING clothes,"This training game teaches puppies not to bite at your clothes, accessories, shoes, shoelaces and hair.  This is one of the first games to play with your new puppy.  My puppy in the video is 8 weeks old and I had just gotten him a few days prior to the filming.  The first few days I had my puppy I first worked on teaching him how to take treats nicely as well as how to do a calm settle around food. 
Here are two video tutorials on those topics:
Calm settle - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wesm2OpE_2c
Take treats nicely - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXDWbtx44b8

It's important to use management and prevention between training sessions so your puppy doesn't rehearse the behavior.  And if a mistake happens and the puppy starts to bite at something or someone quickly redirect the puppy to doing another behavior, such as playing with his toys or going to his bed.  Here is a video on interrupting undesirable behaviors:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLr3ame9Ptk

In the video I demonstrate how to work with a dangling sweater, shoes and shoe laces but you can use this same method to work with your puppy on anything that your puppy shows interest in moving toward and biting... for example if you have long hair and the puppy wants to bite at it, bracelets, dresses, skirts, long jackets, or kids playing with their own toys you don't want the puppy to play with. 

Here is a list of the steps:
Step 1 Mark as the distraction happens
Step 2 Mark after the distraction begins
Step 3 Add more time before you mark
Step 4 Add difficulty and variety to the training

HiziN7mluz8,Dog Training by Kikopup,The Attention Game!,"This training game - The Attention Game - teaches your puppy to WANT to move with you when you move.  It also is a great game to play to motivate your puppy to want to work for treats if you have a puppy that is disinterested in treats and training.  This training game is a great game to play with any puppy or dog to build your relationship.  This is one of the first training games that I play with all my puppies to give them a head start on training. 

The footage is from Halo's first walk with me.  I first let him sniff around and explore the environment, and then we stopped and played this game for 20 seconds... then I encouraged him to go and explore the environment again, telling him ""go sniff"" and pointing to the ground and then followed him around keeping the leash loose.  I suggest playing this game only 1 or 2 times on an outing for only a very short period of time so that the puppy doesn't loose interest. 

If you have a puppy that is over-excited by food or your movement you can use lower value treats and also move in a more subdued way as not to over-excite your puppy.  You can also choose moments when your puppy is calmer.  

All puppies are different so it will depend on the puppies personality as to what to train first.  But the Attention Game is usually the best game to start your training with any puppy.  Here is a video that explains what to train first depending on your puppies personality:

If you don't wish to put the treats down on the ground you can simply feed the treat to the dogs mouth whenever I put the treat down.

This dog trick is great for building your dog's confidence and trust in you as well as a great trick for body awareness.

Max Surla/Media Right Productions

Some of the dog tricks in this video are: bow, sit, down, stand, go in your crate, circle, weave, bop a ball, catch a disc, nod, backward weaves, stay with distraction, put away toys, high five, spin left and right, run in a big circle, hold a disc while doing behaviors, wait your turn while another dog is training.

FYI This video is edited from weeks of training.  I usually spend about 2 minutes a day training him things like I do with my other dogs.  I don't let him bounce on his front legs like that to hit the ball more than 3-6 times. And I've only had him play like that 2 times, and will only have him play the ball game 1 time every 2 weeks or less.  This is because his growth plates are still growing and I don't want him doing a repetitive jolting movement with his front legs.

QhzcXAEmAfg,Dog Training by Kikopup,Cute canine freestyle trick!,"Halo learns the canine freestyle trick of weaving through my arms. By watching the video you can learn how to do the trick if you are a pro, but if you need more guidance I suggest watching the tutorial I created that goes into more depth of how to train this trick after watching this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=596N9hglsPE

The first time I was really impressed by this trick was in 2012 when canine freestyler Vanda Gregorova and her Chihuahua Enrisa Orlen performed it in their routine.  You can see her winning routine here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qDp9Mqvrx0 

I hope this video inspires you to train tricks with your dog!

The content is presented as I would to professional trainers but it also understandable to those who have little or no experience in dog training yet (who are just beginning their exciting journey in learning about dog training).

6Ww6r_5tSH0,Dog Training by Kikopup,Aggressive Demon Dog! - The problem with sensationalizing bad behavior,"In this video I give my opinion on sensationalizing bad behavior in dogs.  For example, exposing dogs to what they react to in order to show what the dog‚Äôs response looked like before training.  Then to go so far as to also label the dog rather than the behavior, such as calling the dog Aggressive, Demonic or Stubborn. This is my opinion and it doesn‚Äôt mean anyone else‚Äôs opinion is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù.   I know I rarely make videos like this that are just opinion based, but I get asked a lot why I do not show the dog ‚Äúbehaving badly‚Äù in the beginning of videos for behavior modification.  Now that I am getting back into making youtube videos I plan to make videos on such topics as reactivity, fear and aggression and now if people ask me why I don‚Äôt show the dog behaving badly I can link this video as the reply.  

I actually DO have a video where I show the dog behaving badly!  It was during a time when we were staying at someone else‚Äôs house and my little Chihuahua was extremely stressed by people coming and going and started to sensitize to the door.  I thought at the time that filming her just that one time before training would help show people that the method works.  But I have to say after filming her, I found that I had taken 50 steps back in her training, and I regretted it.  That I had thought because it was my own dog it was ‚Äúok‚Äù.  Anyway, lesson learned.  Here is the video if you would like to see the occasion where I filmed Kiko and Tug barking at the door.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpzvqN9JNUA 

You might be wondering, how is it possible to know what to do in the training plan for behavior modification if you don‚Äôt ‚ÄúSEE‚Äù the actual problem?  And the answer is, that if you see a dog over threshold it doesn‚Äôt tell you much at all.  What you need to do is expose the dog to the different aspects of the triggers where the dog has no reaction then gradually increase the intensity of the triggers, as you train you find out what are the different aspects the dog was reacting to, but in a very methodical way where you can see just the beginning of the behavior like the dogs ears perking forward, rather than letting the dog react.  (I will be making videos on this method in the future) The goal in training is to have no reactions but of course there might be times when the criteria is a little too high, but the reaction should look very mild compared to what the dog previously would do.  I think it‚Äôs perfectly fine to show mistakes and what to do when you raise criteria too high or if the training session has gone on too long.  But I don‚Äôt believe in setting the dog up to react to something so that you can film the behavior. 

Again, this is my humble opinion and I am not discrediting anyone who believes differently.

xgPSaUT20BU,Dog Training by Kikopup,NEW! Sponsorship LEVELS for Dog Training by Kikopup!,"Hi everybody I have some awesome news! Youtube has changed their channel membership program so that you can choose the amount you wish to sponsor a channel per month. 

To become a member click the JOIN button that is next to the SUBSCRIBE button on my Youtube Channel or click this link here if a join button does not show up on your device such as a phone:  https://www.youtube.com/user/kikopup/join

The point of the channel sponsorship is so that I can indeed make YouTube my full time job which would be a dream for me because I believe I can reach so many more people and create so much more change with my message of training dogs without the use of  physical or psychological intimidation on Youtube than me creating protected material or speaking at conferences where I‚Äôm literally preaching to the crowd who already is on the same pages me. I have traveled the world and I have spoken in every continent at seminars and conferences but the reach on the Internet is so much greater then one person flying around the world which I have been doing for the last 10 years and now I really truly believe that it‚Äôs possible for me to support myself through YouTube thanks to this new sponsorship program! The idea with the different levels of sponsorship is that you pay the amount you can afford to and if you can‚Äôt afford any level then you can enjoy watching the content knowing I‚Äôm being compensated for my work.

The three Kikopup sponsor levels:

Puppy $4.99/month
Exclusive Members-Only Monthly Content- A video post on dog training tips or a how to video will be made on the 1st week of every month.
Instructions: The posts will appear in the Community tab of youtube channel Kikopup. Which can be found here:  https://www.youtube.com/user/kikopup/community

Border Collie 24.99/month
Includes access to perks from previous level.
As well as, Vote on Kikopup's upcoming video topics
Each month you can vote on the video topic for an upcoming video on channel Kikopup. 
Instructions: On the 1st of every month the poll will appear in the community tab on channel Kikopup and will remain there for the next 30 days for voting to take place. I will also reveal the video result from the previous month of voting.  The community tab for channel Kikopup can be found here:  https://www.youtube.com/user/kikopup/community

#1 Kikopup Sponsor $49.99/month
Includes access to perks from the two previous levels
As well as, a Shout-out in 1 video
After you become a sponsor I will say thank you to you and mention your name at the end of one of my videos. (I will do this just once in 1 video when the sponsorship begins and not every month)

Instructions: If your youtube or google account name is different than the name you want mentioned or you would like to remain anonymous, email me at dogmanticsstore@gmail.com (just this email and no other email or social media site) BEFORE you become a sponsor so that I can confirm your request.  The way the sponsorship works is that youtube handles all your personal info so the only info I see when you sign up is the name of your google or youtube account, so for some people this might not be their real name. 

Prices for the different levels of sponsorship vary depending on what country you live in.","['dog training', 'dog trainer', 'professional dog trainer', 'youtube dog trainer', 'youtube dog training', 'channel membership tiers', 'youtube channel membership', 'dog training basics', 'become a sponsor', 'puppy training', 'obedience training', 'emily larlham', 'kikopup', 'dogmantics', 'dog training 101', 'compassionate dog training', 'clicker training', 'how to train a dog', 'free dog training videos', 'sponsor Kikopup', 'youtube channel memberships', 'tiers', 'donate', 'kikopup fan']",2019-07-25T17:41:51Z,PT4M3S,hd,false,4882,184,0,65

In this tutorial I show how to use a food lure and what I suggest to do to set your dog up for success with this trick.  I don't suggest this is the first behavior you train your new puppy or adult dog, because it is easier to train this behavior after the dog has already learned the idea of offering a behavior without a lure.  I suggest first teaching sit and down where you teach your dog to do the behaviors without a lure first before trying to teach bow.

The goal is to go in small enough steps that your dog never even thinks to get up until you release your dog.  If your dog is not staying and getting up more than 2 times in a row it means you need to lower criteria so that your dog can be successful.

It also helps those who can't bend over to teach certain behaviors.  The target stick I am using is quite short.  Its good to start with a short stick or hold the target stick in a way that makes it shorter at first.  But you can use an even longer target stick than the one in the video to make certain training tasks easier.

_3gntre-zyg,Dog Training by Kikopup,Take turns taking treats - Puppy Manners,"How to train your puppy manners when other dogs are receiving treats.  This tutorial shows you how to teach your puppy not to move into other dog's space when the other dog is receiving a treat.  This is a really important exercise to work on so that your other dogs do not feel stressed by another dog competing for their treat when training or getting a snack.  Also teaching dogs to not go near another dog's face when that dog is eating or about to be given a treat is a great safety default behavior, to prevent your dog going into the face of a dog who might possibly guard what he has or is about to be given. By teaching the dogs to respect each others space, it helps reduce the stress in the dogs every day lives making them less likely to have a conflict with each other. 

If you have a dog who is unpredictable, guards food, or you just have never worked with food, you should get a positive reinforcement trainer to help you with this exercise, as well as play it safe and have the dogs in a leash and harness out of reach from each other.  

Here is a link to the video on how to teach your dog to take treats nicely and to understand the treat delivery of when you put a treat between his paws: https://dogmantics.com/what-to-do-if-your-dog-takes-treats-hard/

BIhJj8YvG7A,Dog Training by Kikopup,FUN GAME to teach STAY - Down stay sit stay,"This video is for puppies and adult dogs who are learning a basic stay behavior. In this game you can start teaching the dog to stay reliably with the distraction of walking around the dog in a circle.  Unless you have already worked on this exercise, most dogs will get up if you walk around them because they will try to keep you in their field of vision.  So instead of just walking around the dog and seeing what happens, I suggest to break the steps up small enough so that the dog is successful and not feeling confused by the training.  Breaking the steps up small also prevents the dog from rehearsing the error of getting up before you give the release cue. 

If the dog were to get up during this game, I suggest to not to say ""no"" or ""eh eh"", but instead to quickly lure the dog back into the position, dont give a treat immediately, but then make the step easier for the dog so he can succeed and then mark and reinforce him for that.

Fr6SbfbnZm4,Dog Training by Kikopup,Prevent injury - Don't train on slippery surfaces,"In this video you will find out what surfaces professional dog trainers and performers use to train their dogs and perform with them. 

Tip: If you perform with your dog, say for example you enter a dog trick contest at a fair, it's a good idea to bring a non-slip mat with you to perform your tricks that involve fast movement or jumping.  Not only does this provide your dog with a non-slip surface but it will also provide a distraction free environment if your dog has to perform where other people have dropped treats for example.

Training and performing on a slippery floor is just not worth the risk to your dog.  Not only that, it is not fun for the audience to watch a dog slip while performing.   So if there is no choice but to perform on a slippery surface, either turn down the opportunity or get creative and show off tricks where your dog doesn't have to move, for example, nodding his head, singing, playing cards etc...

In this video I am training my puppy to go in a soft pen so that I can use it to bring places like seminars and camping.  A soft crate is not a good choice to leave a puppy in unattended as they can easily chew through the fabric in seconds.  A better option is a metal exercise pen.  The pen might need a lid and flooring depending on your puppy.

Here is the full written Resource Guarding Protocol:
https://dogmantics.com/resource-guarding-protocol/

It is important to get help from a vet behaviorist to help you create a training plan based on this protocol if you are unsure what your dog might do, you can't read your dog's body language, or you think your dog might nip or bite. 

Stay tuned for more puppy tutorials! I'll be uploading some in the next week!

wqoYc4VZCOg,Dog Training by Kikopup,Teach your puppy his name,"A puppy training tutorial on how to teach your puppy his name.

I suggest your dog‚Äôs name should mean to give you attention but not necessarily come toward you.  So you can say your dog‚Äôs name to get their attention if they are distracted with something, then tell them what you want them to do.  For example ‚ÄúFluffy, leave it‚Äù or ‚ÄúFluffy, come‚Äù.  You don‚Äôt need to say your dog‚Äôs name before you ask your dog to do something if you already have their attention though. And as you can imagine it can get quite repetitive.  

IF your puppy or dog doesn‚Äôt look at you when you say his name after training, it tells you something.  That he is too distracted, you haven‚Äôt conditioned the name enough, you haven‚Äôt proofed it enough, the dog is stressed or the reinforcement isn‚Äôt of high enough value.  Do not keep repeating your dog‚Äôs name if he doesn‚Äôt look at you.  Instead try to move to a less distracting environment.  

Can you change your dog‚Äôs name?  Yes.  It is very simple to change a dog‚Äôs name.  Most likely you will call your dog many nicknames as you might with close friends and family members.  My dogs all have quite a few names they respond to.  Splash is also called Bubu and Tug is called many names including Mr. Snuffles.

If you have adopted a dog with an unknown history, and you are worried their name was paired with punishment more than positive experiences, for example, ‚ÄúFLUFFY! NO!‚Äù, ‚ÄúBAD FLUFFY‚Äù or ‚ÄúFluffy you get here RIGHT NOW! Or else.‚Äù  I suggest to change the name to something that sounds completely different.  This is not confusing for the dog, in the same way it‚Äôs not confusing if your mom calls you one name, but your best friend or partner calls you another name.

3dMKR5i9iNQ,Dog Training by Kikopup,Stop puppy biting with handling games,"This is an in depth tutorial on how to teach your puppy to be calm and relaxed when being handled and petted. The tutorial also covers how to manage and prevent puppy biting as well as what to do if your puppy does bite you or become mouthy.   I will be shortly making another tutorial on how to teach your puppy to not bite your clothes or the leash.  However I do have an older video on that you can check out if you simply cant wait.   

The third step requires the puppy has a few other skills under his belt.  You can train them all as soon as you get your puppy.  And then after a couple of weeks add all the skills together.  My puppy in the video I had been training for 2 weeks already when we were demoing step 3.  As you can see, calm handling pays off!  

The first exercises to work with your puppy on along side handling exercises are:
The default leave it from treats in your hand or bait bag- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRT6r6d79OU&t=156s
The attention noise/eye contact- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4ASIKw-urY&t=2s

YF7boyICV7M,Dog Training by Kikopup,What to Train Your Puppy First,"What to train your puppy in the first few training sessions

In the first few training sessions with your puppy you can choose what to work on first depending on their behavior and personality. 

For all puppies:

‚Ä¢ Settle- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wesm2OpE_2c&t=1s
‚Ä¢ Following a food lure without mouthing or licking- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwQfW54Yh8s
‚Ä¢ Attention noise- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBvPaqMZyo8&
(stay tuned for a new version of this video coming up in the next couple weeks)

 If you have a puppy who seems disinterested in treats:

‚Ä¢ Make sure your puppy has not just eaten a meal before training.  Try a variety of treats of different types and use higher value treats at first. 
‚Ä¢ Attention games- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTSuPk2Ccjo&t
‚Ä¢ Recall- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjd99MlmqqI

If you have a puppy who is over-excited by the treats:

‚Ä¢ Make sure to train after he has had a meal.  Use low value treats like kibble.  
‚Ä¢ Settle- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wesm2OpE_2c&t=1s
‚Ä¢ No mugging- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4IzTn-kMU0

If you have a puppy who acts reserved or timid with handling:

‚Ä¢ Work on handling and restraint- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Otlr6RX7o
‚Ä¢ Touch- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWSJVwZybwo
‚Ä¢ Chinrest- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2lnaerPR5o
‚Ä¢ Avoid working on leave it, impulse control games and no mugging until the pup has built confidence.

pkHuLK5UyAI,Dog Training by Kikopup,Training Sound Sensitive Dogs,"This tutorial covers how to train dogs to not have a fearful response to specific noises like a smoke detector.  I cover how to break the training up into small achievable steps.  

WARNING:
Do not play extremely loud noises for puppies.  Stick to the loudest noises from your phone and computer. NOT the smoke detector at full volume. 



Make sure not to sound the smoke detector near your dog's ears or yours.  I sounded the smoke detector near my dog, because I was filming a video.  You can have someone further away like 10 to 15 feet when pressing the button at full volume.  This needs to be done very briefly so that you do not damage your dog's ears or your own.  Please wear ear plugs for this step.  I suggest that you do not sound it for more than 20 seconds or if you have it go off for longer, have your dog training in a different room so they will not damage their ears. 

If your dog seems to becoming fearful or startling, go back many steps to where your dog is comfortable and not startling at the noise.  Or take a break and try again later with the noise at a low volume.  Every time you start a new training session, I suggest starting from the beginning with noises your dog is comfortable with and at a level of volume your dog is comfortable with so as not to startle the dog at the beginning of a session.  

If you have an extremely fearful or sound sensitive dog I suggest hiring a trainer to help you with this training from the start and not trying to do it yourself in case you increase criteria too quickly and scare your dog.  That said... Trust your gut, if you have a trainer help you and you think they are pushing your dog too quickly... stop them.  As not all trainers are good at reading dogs, and you might be able to read your dog's body language better than the trainer.

oAk8eMRHYjU,Dog Training by Kikopup,How to Read Your Dog's Body Language When Training,"How to read your dog‚Äôs body language in training sessions. Firstly we shall look at what the ears of the dog are telling us during a training session. When training a dog you want to shoot for the ear position on the left: POINTED AT YOU, relaxed or perky. I call these ears ‚Äúexpectant‚Äù they are expressing that the dog is expecting something to happen that he is not conflicted about. The ear positions on the right, POINTED AWAY FROM YOU give you information that your dog might be feeling somehow conflicted, uncomfortable or anxious.

Don‚Äôt panic if you see your dogs ears go back during training. Your dog is just communicating with you. When you see the ears go back, you can tweak your training plan by breaking the training up into smaller steps and trying to figure out what is making your dog feel uncomfortable so you can get those ears back up and looking perky or relaxed.

Your dog‚Äôs ears will also move around if he is listening to sounds in the environment. This is also information though, as when his ears are moving around, he will not be as focused on learning so don‚Äôt train a new behavior in a distracting environment until you have his full focus. Dogs also put their ears back in every day life when greeting dogs or people. This is normal dog behavior.

Want to become a trainer that is great at reading dogs? Film your training sessions, and when you watch back the footage, pay attention to just one part of your dog‚Äôs body during the whole session ‚Äì his eyes, his mouth, his neck, feet, body posture or ears. To begin with, watch your dog‚Äôs ears. By watching back the footage you will see things you missed while training.

When a dog is directly in front of you during a training session, the dog‚Äôs gaze should ideally be POINTED AT YOU, the reinforcement or in the direction of the task. If you notice the dog‚Äôs gaze start to POINT AWAY FROM YOU or the task, this gives you vital information about what to do next in the training session.

Dogs can look away during training for many reasons. Some reasons include, that the dog is uncomfortable or stressed, that the reinforcement is not of high enough value, the session has gone on too long or that the dog is simply distracted by the surrounding environment. Regardless of the reasons, the dog is not paying 100% attention and is not 100% in the training game. When a dog starts to look away, you can reassess if something is causing the dog to feel uncomfortable. There could be some unintended social pressure you were unaware of, for example the dog could perhaps be feeling uncomfortable that you are leaning over him. If you believe this is not the case, you can see if using a higher value of reinforcement will get your dog back in the game. If this does not work, it‚Äôs not a good idea to train new behaviors without having your dog‚Äôs full attention. You can either give your dog a break or you can ask for behaviors that your dog knows and loves and use a higher rate of reinforcement. It is normal for dogs to be slightly distracted during training when working in new environments for the first time. So I suggest when you begin training somewhere new, warm up with attention games, your dog‚Äôs strongest behaviors or a settle.

In a training session with your dog in front of you take note of your dog‚Äôs body posture. The ideal picture is that your dog‚Äôs posture is relaxed in a neutral position or leaning toward you, the task or the reinforcement. When you see your dog‚Äôs neck and chest start to shift away from you, downward, to the side or back away from you or the task, this is giving you information. Imagine you are talking to someone and you see them leaning their chest and neck in your direction. They most likely feel comfortable with you and are engaged in what you have to say. Then you see them start to lean away from you‚Ä¶ Something has changed. If they are just getting comfortable, that‚Äôs a different story. But if you see their center of their body start to point elsewhere‚Ä¶ It is information. The same is true with dogs.

All dogs communicate differently with their body posture just like people. Also, outside of training sessions your dog might change his body posture according to different social scenarios. Your dog might have the tendency to greet you or other dogs with a submissive appeasing posture or lean away from another dog who is trying to lick him.

Just to note, I don‚Äôt condone having young kids hug dogs but used the picture for ‚Äúleaning to the side‚Äù because it is a very good visual example of a dog feeling uncomfortable. You will also notice the facial expression is very telling.

yLr3ame9Ptk,Dog Training by Kikopup,STOP unwanted behavior without INTIMIDATION,"How to interrupt your dog in TEN WAYS from doing undesirable behavior without having to use physical or psychological intimidation. 

Is saying ‚Äúno‚Äù ‚Äúeh-eh‚Äù or pushing on your dog‚Äôs rear to get them to sit cruel or inhumane?  No.  Of course it‚Äôs not.  But is it in line with the idea of training by reinforcing behavior. No. It is not.   When you start adding in physical or psychological intimidation into your training, even the mildest, you change a simple picture into a very complex one.  It is no longer easy to tell why an animal isn‚Äôt performing a specific behavior.  And by mixing intimidation and reinforcers, you can water down the reinforcement value of your reinforcers causing you to have to turn to harsher and more frequent intimidation‚Ä¶ because the ‚Äúreinforcement is not working‚Äù.  Punishment for incorrect behavior implies that the animal did something wrong rather than the training plan being badly thought out, so if you didn‚Äôt break the steps up correctly for the dog to learn, the dog is punished rather than the trainer.  

The side effects of mixing physical and psychological intimidation into training is that you water down the reinforcers you use in the process, making them not as powerful.  This makes it difficult to work with your dog when you are competing with other reinforcing things in the environment as the dog can seem like he doesn‚Äôt really want to be around you or what you have to offer and prefers the other things over you. And it can seem like your dog is ‚Äúblowing you off‚Äù, being stubborn, or not listening because he is naughty.  The only option you then have is turning to more intimidation and punishment to get your dog to listen and stay with you.

The problem with main stream dog training such as shows on tv, is that you will be told what you want to hear and what agrees with what you already know to keep you listening and engaged.  You want to hear that you simply just say ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù or throw something at your dog to get them to behave.  Easy peasy just what you wanted to hear.  If it was as simple as that to change behavior without behavioral or psychological side effects, then there would be no jails because we could just tell those who have committed a crime ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and threaten them to not do it again. 

The truth is, the training plan that will be the most effective with the least amount of side effects isn‚Äôt something easy or what you already believe to work.  If so you probably wouldn‚Äôt be still having the issue.  Sometimes the most effective solution, does involve a time commitment and careful planning of a behavior modification plan.  It is, of course always disappointing to find this out.  That you actually have more work and learning to do than you anticipated, but do you want to be fed the truth or keep sailing down the river of being fed what you want to hear?

The idea behind this challenge came from watching videos of the ""egg challenge"" where people sometimes just pushed a chicken egg into their dog's mouth to see what their dog would do.  Instead I am suggesting to train a ""delicate hold"" as a fun game that your dog enjoys with the final result being that your dog has an advanced dog trick under his belt.   

Here is a link to a video tutorial on how to train your dog to hold an easter egg delicately after he already can hold and fetch things: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRdC82Yl90

aI52a3u_Qvw,Dog Training by Kikopup,Teach your dog to down - Troubleshooting,"This video is for those of you struggling to teach your dog to initially get into the down position so you can start training a down stay. 

Tricks for teaching a down when simply luring it doesn‚Äôt work:

1 Lure the dog under something like your leg or a chair to get the behavior started.  (I learned this trick about 15 years ago from dog trainer Kate Palese.  Not sure who came up with this clever trick.)

2 Use non-slip flooring.  You can also try using his dog bed or a soft couch.

3 When you see your dog lay down during everyday life, mark it by saying ‚Äúyes!‚Äù or simply act very happy and go and get him a treat.  This will cause the behavior to increase and make your dog more likely to offer the down in training sessions.

Some reasons dogs might not want to lay down:

1 They don‚Äôt understand what you want
2 The reinforcement is not of high enough value in that situation
3 The flooring is slippery or hard  
4 The dog is worried about something in the environment
5 The dog could have an injury or pain in his body that you are unaware of

dJkVfCuNraE,Dog Training by Kikopup,The misuse of muzzles in dog training,"A muzzle is like a seat belt. It reduces injury but doesn‚Äôt prevent accidents.

I have noticed a recent trend of the misuse of muzzles and the misunderstanding of their function in a behavior modification plan. No one puts on a seat belt and then suddenly drives carelessly. Yet, often times people put muzzles on their dogs and knowingly put them into situations they can‚Äôt cope without working on their behavioral issues systematically using a training plan.

The problem

The problem with just putting a muzzle on a dog and then putting him into situations where he is uncomfortable without training is that the dog will still be feeling and acting fearful, agitated or aggressive. He has not been given the skills to cope through training. If the dog were to bite, even though the dog can do less damage, it will still most likely be reinforcing to the dog. If a behavior is rehearsed, even if the dog has a muzzle on, the behavior will be more likely to happen in the future.

Not only is putting a dog unnecessarily into a situation that is too much for him unfair for that dog, but it is also unfair for the dogs that are exposed to that dog.

A dog acting fearful, over-aroused or aggressive in a muzzle is still as worrisome to other dogs. Being attacked or threatened by a dog in a muzzle can be just as traumatic for some dogs as sustaining injuries from being bitten.

The solution

DO continue to use muzzles! But create a behavior modification plan that sets the dog up so that he can cope every step of the way. Sure there will be times that your dog might get stressed, but the idea is to create a plan to prevent or reduce undue stress.

    Avoid unpredictable, crowded, stressful environments until your training is complete
    Avoid areas where other dogs are off leash
    Set up training sessions where you can train your dog and also be in control of the environment. For example, work with a calm decoy dog or person who will listen to you so you can create distance if needed or get closer as your dog succeeds to build his confidence without something unpredictable happening that might cause a set back.
    Train your dog to accept handling, grooming and restraint using Positive Reinforcement, so that when it is needed your dog will not be as stressed by it.
    Learn to read your dog‚Äôs body language for signs of undue stress. Different dogs exhibit different signs. Here are some examples: pinning ears back, becoming hyper vigilant, panting, dilated pupils, raised hackles, vocalizing, fearful or aggressive displays.
    Remove your dog from situations that are too stressful.

Train your dog to use a muzzle

It‚Äôs a great idea to teach every dog to feel comfortable wearing a muzzle. Emergencies can happen where your dog might suddenly need to be at the vet with an injury and might act unpredictably because of pain. Some countries require muzzles for public transportation. A muzzle is also a great piece of equipment to use for working with fear, reactivity and aggression in dogs. Where the dog is set up to succeed and the muzzle is just there in case of an unexpected emergency, like a seat belt.

Here is a video on how to condition a dog to feel comfortable wearing a muzzle:

The basic concept is to practice how much pressure you will use with the brush you have chosen to brush your dog with on the back of your hand.  Often times, you will be surprised to find out that the bristles of the brush feel quite uncomfortable and even painful when a lot of pressure is used.  So you can practice brushing with light pressure on your own hand before brushing your dog.  Also relax, take a deep breath.  And stop rushing.  There are many dogs who dislike being brushed frantically who instead do much better with being brushed calmly and gently.

cXX_sc3Bqx4,Dog Training by Kikopup,"Why I Don't Use Intimidation or Say ""No!' to Train Cues - Dog Training","I don't use intimidation or say ""No!' when training cues (or what others call Commands) because I want the cue to eventually become a Secondary Reinforcer.  Something the dog likes hearing, something that drives the dog to want to do the behavior asked and something that will reinforce the previous behavior the dog just did.  A lot of people think I don‚Äôt use intimidation or say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù or ‚ÄúEh-Eh‚Äù when training because I think it is cruel or I am extremist.  But this is simply not true.  One of the many reasons is, I want strong reliable behavior.  For compulsion trainers, they turn to stronger Punishers to ‚Äúget‚Äù behavior.  As a trainer who relies on Positive Reinforcement to ‚Äúget‚Äù behavior, I turn to stronger Reinforcers.  Adding punishers to training, can wash down the reinforcement value of not only your Primary Reinforcement you use like the treats you use but also Secondary Reinforcers you build, like your Cues, praise, toys or access to the environment.  Once that happens, most people turn to more extreme punishment, to get behavior.  Than realizing it was the watering down of the reinforcers that caused the issue to begin with. 

Whether you like it or not ‚ÄúPavlov is on your shoulder‚Äù as Bob Bailey says. Remember the guy who trained the dog to drool at the sound of a bell by repeatedly giving the dog food after hearing the sound of the bell?  What if sometimes he gave food and sometimes there wasn‚Äôt food or he said ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù when the bell rang?  As you can imagine, the bell would not be conditioned to create a positive emotional response as fast for that dog than a dog who hears the bell and 100% of the time something good happens afterward.  

An intimidating tone of voice, obviously makes it much harder to change the cue into a Secondary Reinforcer for most dogs. As most dogs tend to find an intimidating tone of voice aversive.  So instead of trying to ‚Äúundo‚Äù the aversive quality of an intimidating tone of voice, you can simply say the cue in a positive tone of voice.  Saying a cue in an intimidating, loud or condescending way with intimidating body language, makes the ‚Äúcommand‚Äù you give your dog a threat‚Ä¶. SO the behavior is driven by the dog doing the behavior to get you to end the intimidation.  This can seem to work faster‚Ä¶ in the beginning, but what can happen is when you ask for many behaviors, the dog can begin to get stressed by this, as there is no way to avoid the intimidating voice - after completing a behavior perfectly the intimidating voice happens again with a new behavior.  The dog never has the opportunity to find a way to avoid you saying the cues in an intimidating voice. 

If my training skills are not up to par, to break up the steps in a way that the dog is successful every step of the way, if using punishers like ‚ÄúNo‚Äù or corrections, the dog is punished for my lack of skills rather than me.  With this type of training when dogs make errors the trainer is more likely to assume it‚Äôs the dog that is the problem rather than their training plan. 

If you are a compulsion trainer watching this video, imagine this scenario - you would not give a dog reinforcement right after a secondary punisher, because the secondary punisher would become less effective as a punisher.  Punishment and reinforcement mirror each other especially with the conditioning process.  So if you have a Secondary Reinforcer like your cue ‚ÄúSit‚Äù if you have trained it with Positive Reinforcement, and you punish the dog after saying the cue, the cue ‚ÄúSit‚Äù starts to loose its quality as a Secondary Reinforcer. 

The key to reliable behavior is all in conditioning, proofing and generalization, not whether you use punishment or reinforcement.  So just because you use reinforcement doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll get reliable behavior if you don‚Äôt set up your training plan correctly. 

Of course, I am not saying that by just using reinforcement, you will avoid frustration, anxiety or even aggression.  Raising criteria too quickly or staying on the same level for too long before trying to raise criteria can cause all of these problems and I don‚Äôt doubt an animal can feel just as stressed by this as an animal being trained with punishment in certain situations.

LWAf0IbsAYg,Dog Training by Kikopup,Submissive Urination when Greeting,"Dog Training by Kikopup - Submissive Urination when Greeting People

This video covers how to train and prevent your puppy or adult dog from urinating when greeting a family member, friend or stranger.  Some puppies will grow out of this behavior, but for others the behavior can continue into adulthood. 

The most important concept to remember is to try and keep your cool if your dog does urinate even though it can feel frustrating and embarrassing especially if the dog pees on the guest‚Äôs shoe, something expensive or hard to clean.  The problem with acting frustrated or angry is that it will make the dog more likely to submissively pee when greeting you the next time as greeting predicts the person getting angry. 
 
The first plan of action is preventing the behavior from happening by ‚Äúchanging the picture‚Äù.  All dogs are different and have different stimuli trigger them to urinate.  For some dogs it‚Äôs even simply the sight of their owner coming through the door after work. 

Here is a list of things that can trigger submissive urination:
‚Ä¢ The dog has not seen the person for a long time
‚Ä¢ A direct approach
‚Ä¢ Direct eye contact
‚Ä¢ Standing directly in front of the dog
‚Ä¢ Leaning over the dog
‚Ä¢ Touching the dog ‚Äì calmly, excitedly or playfully
‚Ä¢ Talking to the dog ‚Äì normally, in a high pitched voice or loud

What you can do instead:
‚Ä¢ Wait until the dog has had time to calm down before interacting
‚Ä¢ Let the dog approach you rather than approaching the dog
‚Ä¢ Avoid a direct approach by walking in an arc toward the dog if you approach
‚Ä¢ Avoid direct eye contact and blink at the dog if you do look at the dog
‚Ä¢ Stand facing to the side when near the dog 
‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt lean over, pet or talk to the dog until the dog has had enough time to calm down. 
‚Ä¢ Pet the dog with the dog at your side rather than directly in front of you.
‚Ä¢ Move calmly and slowly. 
‚Ä¢ Immediately stop interacting with the dog and walk away if you see the dog start to lower their hips, squat or roll over. 

Submissive urination is usually more likely to happen during the initial meeting after not seeing the person for a long time or meeting a new person.  What you can do is change the dog‚Äôs expectation of what will happen during the initial meeting.  Instead of what typically happens, an immediate social interaction upon seeing the person, you can make the initial appearance of the person predict something else, for example, being fed, working for treats or getting to go out to go to the bathroom. 

With family members

When arriving home, you can change your dog‚Äôs motivation by dropping treats on the floor or giving the dog a high value chew.  You can also make the initial meeting about going outside to go to the bathroom.  Instead of saying ‚ÄúHI!!! FLUFFY!!!‚Äù You can open the door and in a casual voice say, ‚ÄúDo you need to go out?‚Äù and without looking at your dog walk around your yard looking interested in the bushes or places in the grass.  If your dog jumps on you, you can also do this but sprinkle treats in the grass to point out to your dog to get your dog interested in sniffing around. 

After your dog has calmed down, say 10 mins after you get home, you can then give your dog the excited attention you wanted to when first seeing your dog.  This works great for family members who get over-excited by their dogs, as it gives them also a chance to calm down before interacting with the dog.   

With guests

Have your dog on a leash and harness or in a pen and let your dog calm down first before getting to greet the person.   You can give your dog treats for settling on his dog bed. 

Instead of jumping right into petting, have the guests feed your dog a treat to change the dog‚Äôs motivation from greeting to expecting food.  You could also get the person to ask your dog for his favorite behaviors or tricks.  After each behavior the dog can receive a treat from the person. 

 You can teach your dog to touch the person‚Äôs hand or rest chin in the person‚Äôs hand as a behavior so the dog is touching the person at first rather than the person touching the dog.

Ask the guest to stop petting your dog and move away from your dog if you see your dog start to lower his hips, squat or begin to roll over.

knYNa0U5QZU,Dog Training by Kikopup,Dog not motivated by food,"In this video I show what to do if your dog has little or no interest in training with food.

If you are using food to train your dog, I suggest not leaving food down for free feeding. I suggest feed your dog breakfast and dinner, but pick the bowl up after your dog is done eating.  If your dog seems disinterested in a meal and doesn‚Äôt want to eat it,  pick the bowl back up and offer it to the dog in an hour.  

I suggest changing the treats you use often and use different treats to the food you feed your dog.  By changing the treats you use you will create variety.  Most dogs love novelty.

KXDWbtx44b8,Dog Training by Kikopup,Take Treats NICELY and GENTLY - Puppy Dog Training,"Teach your dog or puppy to take treats nicely and gently. 

Set yourself up for success by teaching a calm settle first before playing the games if your dog takes treats extremely hard

Here is a video link to the tutorial on the settle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wesm2OpE_2c
This is the first step that I would do with dogs who get extremely excited about food.

What you will do is have food on you all day, and when you see your dog relaxed and not thinking about food, you can present food between your dog‚Äôs paws. Then ignore your dog until he once again is not thinking about the food and looks very calm. He most likely will eat the treat with less gusto than if he had waited for you to take the treats from the fridge to the training area and then feed him in a state of anticipation.

Game 1

Choose a time to train when your dog is relaxed. Slowly move to put a treat down on the ground under his chin. If your dog touches or paws at your hand, slowly withdraw your hand and begin again. The behavior you are looking for is the dog patiently waiting for you to release the treat before going to eat it.

Game 2

First begin with a low value treat while your dog is calm. Slowly move to give your dog a treat. Bring your hand in close enough that your dog doesn‚Äôt have to stretch out his neck to get the treat. When you feel only your dogs lips and tongue and not his teeth let go of the treat. If you feel hard teeth, hold on to the treat, or slowly remove your hand and represent it slowly.

Practice with the dog in different positions in relation to you, to help the dog generalize the behavior.

Game 3

This exercise is for people who struggle to get their dog to take treats softly. So if you have success with Game 1 and 2 this game is not necessary.

Hold a treat between your fingers, that you can easily hold onto if the dog tries to take it with his teeth. Wait and see if the dog licks the treat. If he licks the treat let it go. If he doesn‚Äôt keep waiting or try to hold the treat in a different way that might give him the idea to lick it. You can first have your dog lick a thin layer peanut butter off a spoon to give him the idea of licking instead of biting.

Once your dog is reliably licking the treat out of your fingers, you can say your cue ‚ÄúLick‚Äù or whatever cue you wish, like ‚ÄúGentle‚Äù, before your dog licks it out of your hand.

It‚Äôs important to add the cue after your dog is calm and has started to take treats softly. Most dog owners say ‚Äúgentle‚Äù every time they think their dog might take the treat hard, which is when the dog is excited. It is a much better idea to associate the cue when the dog is calm and the dog is already offering the behavior.

First play these games with low value treats and then higher value treats. Practice these games with the dog in different positions in relation to you as well as in different training locations, to help the dog generalize the behavior. When you first begin you can play the games after your dog has had a meal and is less interested in food.

Adding the clicker and marker words

When the dog is successfully taking treats softly you can start to click or say your verbal marker before giving the treat. First test to see if your dog is taking treats softly. Then practice the same games, but this time click or use a marker before moving to present the treat. Most dogs will get excited by hearing the marker and so most likely will want to take the treat hard at first.

What to do in training sessions to prevent the dog taking the treat hard as you train your dog to take treats softly:

    Feed your dog with the treat in the center of a flat palm like you would feed a horse
    Put the treat down on the ground
    Toss a treat to your dog or on the ground (This might excite the dog, so only use this for behaviors you want your dog to be excited during)

Brush up sessions

If you notice your dog regresses to taking treats hard in training, either stop the training session or feed your dog in a way he cannot take treats hard. Then plan to do brush up lessons on taking treats calmly later when your dog is more relaxed. Suddenly beginning a ‚Äútake the treats nicely‚Äù lesson when the dog takes a treat hard in a training session could possibly train your dog that he can make the training game easier if he simply bites your fingers.

Suddenly taking treats hard is a sign that the dog is excited or stressed. So it is actually a good way to know how your dog is feeling and that you might need to change your training plan.","['gentle', 'dog training', 'train positive', 'bites', 'bites hand', 'takes treats hard', 'hard mouth', 'dog hard mouth', 'solving', 'how to stop biting', 'Stop taking treats hard', 'puppy taking treats hard', 'kikopup', 'dog takes treats roughly', 'stop biting', 'manners taking treats', 'train GENTLE', 'youtube dog trainer', 'puppy training', 'dog take treats gently', 'Best dog trainer', 'online dog training', 'how to train a puppy', 'professional', 'free dog training course', 'how to train puppy to not bite']",2019-01-19T03:16:44Z,PT11M26S,hd,false,54478,936,0,74
haYAD9eDBzc,Dog Training by Kikopup,2 Cases DOG BODY LANGUAGE can be MISINTERPRETED - Dog Training,"In this video I talk about 2 cases in which body language can often be misinterpreted in dogs. 

Shivering can be caused by fear or excitement, but it could also simply be that your dog is cold.  Keep in mind illness, injury, low blood sugar or hypoglycemia can also account for shivering.

Tail carriage and what your dog does with his tail can also have a different meaning depending on your dog‚Äôs breed.  A beagle for example, would tend to keep their tail high over their back, while a whippet would keep their tail low when relaxed.  In this video I talk about how the tail tucked between the legs can sometimes simply be the sign that the dog is cold.  Some dogs with very little hair or delicate skin, will tuck their tail under them to sit or lay down on hard or uncomfortable surfaces.  Tucking the tail can also be a sign of physical or psychological discomfort or fear.  A dog might also tuck their tail to prevent another dog sniffing them or because of injury or illness.

In dog training literature a relaxed and open mouth is said to be the sign that a dog is relaxed.  But in this video I talk about looking at the whole picture.

4bXf5TZ3q28,Dog Training by Kikopup,What TO do and what NOT to do if your dog runs away and doesn't listen,"In this tutorial I talk about what to do if you were in a situation where your dog ran away from you and didn‚Äôt come back.  Now obviously, the solution is to not get into that situation to begin with, by training your dog to reliably be with you off leash and to reliably come when called and not having your dog off leash or in unsafe areas.  But I created this video because I often see people suddenly in a situation they have not planned for and do not now what to do, for example, yesterday when I was at the park and a woman was trying to catch her loose dog.  What happened, as I explain in the video, is that when she caught her dog she did something that would make the dog less likely to come back to her if the dog were ever to be loose again. 

This video doesn't explain what to do to prevent your dog from running away, nor does it explain how to get your dog to listen to you no matter what.  This tutorial is for those who find themselves in the situation where their dog is off leash and suddenly not listening to them.

mFy6kjcK22M,Dog Training by Kikopup,Leash Walking CONNECTED - loose leash walking course,"üêïüöÇ STOP pulling on leash! - Does your dog pull on leash like a freight train and is too stressed to even take treats on a walk?  Leash Walking CONNECTED is a 6 Week Self-Study Course that gives you a 6 week plan on what to train and how frequently to train it to get you and your dog's training back on track.  The price of the course is 49$ for a lifetime of access to the material.

This is the ULTIMATE Leash Walking course to teach your dog to relax and want to walk by your side when out and about.

About this self-study course:

If loose leash walking was as simple to teach as stopping when your dog pulls and moving when your dog is next to you‚Ä¶ most people would succeed with training their dogs to walk on a loose leash. For some dogs it is as easy as this, while for others it‚Äôs not. I believe the main reason people struggle with loose leash walking is that the pulling is the symptom of another problem, so no matter how hard you work at it the pulling keeps coming back. The main problem that I believe to be the cause of pulling is that the dog is over excited or stressed when out and about. This 6 week intensive program focuses on exercises that are designed to not only teach your dog to walk next to you, but also how to practice impulse control and calm down in order to get to the root of the leash walking problem. Each week you will be working on a variety of exercises ranging from working on a ‚ÄúSettle‚Äù, relationship building exercises like the ‚ÄúRecall‚Äù and ‚ÄúAttention noise‚Äù, ‚ÄúLeave it‚Äù exercises, and building the concept of walking at your side. Because the training is conducted with no forms of physical or psychological intimidation, all these exercises benefit any behavior modification program.

This self-study course is comprised of an introduction and 6 weeks of online written and video lessons explaining how to train your dog the weekly exercises. There is also a PDF handout to download with quick reminders of how to train each of the exercises. The handout also contains weekly charts to fill in, showing you exactly which exercises to work on each week and how many times to work on each exercise.

This course is perfect for anyone who has watched my Video on Demand on Reactivity or Harnessing the Hunter as it mirrors the leash walking methods used in both yet goes into more detail and explains precisely how to advance from week 1 to week 6 with the different exercises. I designed this leash walking course after receiving many emails from those who wanted a course that could help them know precisely what to practice each week, how many times to practice the exercises and when to increase criteria. During the 6 weeks you will be focusing on teaching new behaviors, increasing criteria, and taking your training on the road. The exercises are cleverly ordered so that previously learned skills set the dog up for the exercises in the next week‚Äôs lesson.

After 12 years of helping others with their dogs who pull on leash, I have refined this 6 week program for focusing on loose leash walking. Many of the techniques I use are based on the teachings I learned from my most wonderful mentor Kyle Rayon so many years ago, yet have withstood the test of time. Some of the techniques I have changed or added to, as well as come up with unique ways to train specific exercises.

Who is this course for?

This self-study course is for anyone who has a dog 6 months or older that pulls when on a leash. It is designed for those whose dogs pull from time to time as well as for those with dogs who pull like a freight train. The material is explained in a way that someone new to owning and training a dog can easily understand, yet the content should also be beneficial for even advanced trainers.

Because this is an intensive 6 week course focusing on leash walking for dogs who already pull, it is not suited for young puppies as they need a much broader initial education and socialization. Check out my ‚ÄòWeekly Puppy Insights‚Äô membership which briefly covers basic leash walking with puppies.

If you have a dog who is so strong that you cannot control your dog on your own or a dog who can become overly fearful, reactive or aggressive, consult a trainer who uses intimidation-free training in order to help you with these exercises which can easily be incorporated into any behavior modification program. This will keep both you and your dog safe.

Happy Training!

nBAz0kqeJYg,Dog Training by Kikopup,STOP UNWANTED behaviors with BACK UP!,"Dog training video on BACK UP - In this tutorial you will learn how to teach your dog to back up when you move into your dog‚Äôs space.  This tutorial is not necessary for every dog but is great for dogs who seem to lack a sense of personal space, seem pushy or can easily become over aroused and want to climb up you. For example, when you are sitting on the couch, and your dog get‚Äôs too close to you or climbs on you or climbs up you.  This tutorial is also an excellent exercise to teach your dog if they can become fearful or reactive towards dogs and people, as you will be conditioning the dog to have a positive emotional response to someone moving into their space.  

It‚Äôs really important that if you have a dog who you are uncertain who will become overly reactive, fearful or aggressive when interacting with you that you do hire a professional trainer who doesn‚Äôt use intimidation to train to go through these steps first with your dog before they give you the OK to work with your dog alone.  A trainer can help know when to lower or raise criteria as well as be able to read your dogs signals that they are feeling uncomfortable.  

The video covers how to train your dog the behavior.  Once you have done 10-12 short sessions of teaching this behavior, you can then start to use the cue in real life scenarios.  When your dog is doing something you don‚Äôt like - like climbing on you, it‚Äôs important to not reinforce the dog with a treat after they listen to you to back up.  Instead, redirect the dog to doing a behavior you DO want your dog to do.  Like go to his bed or play with his toys on his own.  Then at other points in the day, make a habit of reinforcing the behaviors you do want your dog to do.  If you reinforce your dog with a treat right after they back up from jumping on you, you can inadvertently reinforce a chain of behaviors which includes the one you didn‚Äôt like.  If your cue doesn‚Äôt work in real life scenarios it will need more conditioning by repetition in training sessions where the dog is calm and relaxed.   Interrupting your dog‚Äôs undesirable behavior is just one piece of the training puzzle.  Please review my previous video to learn more about this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vAk98000wc&t=2s  When training a dog, the idea is is that STOPPING the behavior is not the biggest part of the solution as REPLACING it with the behavior you DO want your dog to do.  Interrupting behavior is just a way to prevent those behaviors from attaining a reinforcement history.  The sooner you interrupt and redirect dogs the less likely there will be a reinforcement history created for the undesirable behavior.  So interrupting behavior is part of the training plan, but training and reinforcing the behaviors you like will play the biggest role in your behavior modification plan for your dog.

Most free dog training information on TV and the web is quite dated, unless you really know where to look.  I have seen in the last few years the information on dog training that is public has taken a few steps backward‚Ä¶ the message of COMPASSION has gotten lost along the way.  I truly believe the best way to create change in the dog training world is to refocus my energy back to making Youtube videos.  I was lucky enough to be invited to travel around the world and teach thanks to Youtube at the beginning of my career.  Not only did I spend the last 9 years teaching but I also got to learn from the best trainers out there all around the globe. Spending two years in Europe with my dogs really opened my eyes to how far ahead the Europeans are‚Ä¶ I have learned so much and am eager to share my knowledge with you.  Filming and editing takes a lot of time so there is no way I can do this alone without the support of members like you. 

THANK YOU!  You will be supporting my work and giving me an ability to do this full time without having to resort to donations or sponsors. Remember you can end your membership at anytime you want.  Take note the price of membership differs between what country you live in.  So it could be a few dollars cheaper or a 1 or 2 bucks more depending where you live but it will show you the price for your country.  :)

596N9hglsPE,Dog Training by Kikopup,Cute dog trick tutorial,"How to train your dog to weave between your arms as you crawl forward.  It is a great trick to show off your toy dog!  

The first time I was really impressed by this trick was in 2012 when canine freestyler Vanda Gregorova and her Chihuahua Enrisa Orlen performed it in their routine.  You can see her winning routine here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qDp9Mqvrx0&t=74s 

In this tutorial I give an example of also what you can do if you are too embarrassed to crawl on the ground or perhaps if you are not physically able to.  
Here's a training tutorial on how to teach basic leg weaving :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mua6TSnEz8Q

BkDUaa2Ww20,Dog Training by Kikopup,Down Stay From Heel - Dog Training by Kikopup,"This obedience behavior of doing a down stay during heelwork, where you cue a down stay while your dog is at your side and you move forward, is a fun game and the final behavior usually looks quite impressive.  This game is great for proofing a down stay and is a great game if you do canine freestyle as well. 

You don't need to use intimidation to train this behavior.  So keep your tone of voice positive and upbeat. Here is an article on why you might consider using a positive tone of voice with your dog https://dogmantics.com/toneofvoice/

Here is a video from ten years ago on teaching go to the mat, drop at heel and drop on recall using a mat. However, I plan to refilm drop on recall because the video is pixelated.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVGaslyGaGE&t=23s

Is it clear why I'm luring the dog over the mat at first instead of just beginning in the heel position?  The reason is that as the dog learns the new behavior, you don't  want to mess up your heeling.  Then when the dog understands the down and wait, you can add the two together.

Don't forget to give a ""thumbs up"" if you want more ""obedience"" videos without using intimidation.

K2lnaerPR5o,Dog Training by Kikopup,EASY Chin Rest - Dog Training by Kikopup,"I really like to teach a chin rest using free shaping, as well as using counter conditioning the dog to find a hand reaching into his space a pleasant experience in the way I learned it from my mentor Kyle Rayon.  However, I have found over the years that following the steps in an online video is difficult for someone who is new to training.  Also over the years of doing seminars in other countries, I have found this technique of using luring to teach the chin rest the fastest and most reliable to use in a seminar environment.  The great thing about the technique is that the dog is moving into your space all the time, so it‚Äôs easy to see if the dog is finding it too much.  Where if you reach into your dog‚Äôs space, even if he stays there and doesn‚Äôt move away, it‚Äôs hard to know how comfortable he is.  I also find by playing ‚Äúhard to get‚Äù it increases the dog‚Äôs confidence.

If you have a dog who has never been touched or you know has a history of being fearful, aggressive or resource guards, please hire a professional trainer who doesn‚Äôt use intimidation to train to help you through the training process for your safety and the safety of the dog.  Sometimes more training is needed to lower the dog‚Äôs arousal around food and build trust in you first before beginning this exercise.

If you have a dog who is too excited about the treats to take them nicely or learn the behavior: 
1- have treats in a treat bag on you all day long and when your dog is not thinking about the food and settled and relaxed calmly go and drop the treat. This will help your dog not get revved by the treat bag or container coming out. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wesm2OpE_2c
 2 - https://dogmantics.com/taking-treats-nicely/ here is a tutorial to get the dog calmly taking treats 3 - work on a calm marker that predicts you will deliver the treat in a calm manner 4 - for the moment don‚Äôt train before meals- train after meals (make sure not to do anything too active) 5 - use lower value treats at first, slowly build up to higher value treats - feed a variety for meals to prevent novelty being so exciting.

unjAZ6SSGBs,Dog Training by Kikopup,"Say ""Yes!"" to NAIL TRIMMING! - Dog Training","A FULL TUTORIAL on how to train a dog to lay upside down for grooming can be found here :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EITYvqs32Hg&t=342s   
Not ALL dogs like being upside down like this, so grooming standing up is another option.  But I do suggest you slowly work on teaching the dog to trust you when upside down for other grooming or health care emergencies.  Also make sure to never have a dog lay on their back after drinking a lot of water or eating a meal- sometimes this can cause the stomach to twist which is a very dangerous condition. I like this way of grooming because I can see the nails better, and the dog can tell me to stop, by lifting his head.  

Here Splash is lifting her head to tell me I am a ""Dork"" and by putting her head down shes telling me to get back to work so she can earn more treats. 

Happy Training!  

Don't be discouraged if your dog is not a fan of having his nails done.  It is extremely common that dogs dislike their nails being cut and also not an easy or quick process to work on it.  However because it has to be done, its a good idea to take the time to make it a more pleasant experience for the dog, so that every time you trim your dog's nails you aren't compromising your relationship.  Some dogs who have sensitive feet or arthritis like my terrier, need constant training so that they can put up with the discomfort of having the job done.  If your dog is scared having his feet touched or you simply dont know what would happen if you touch his feet, its best to get a trainer who uses no forms of intimidation to come and help you at the beginning of the training process to know how to break the steps up small enough for your dog and when it is the right time to move on to the next step.  You can also search for articles and videos on using sand paper glued to a board, that you then teach your dog to scratch and sand his own nails as you work on teaching your dog to have his nails done.

S1XFsV18qqQ,Dog Training by Kikopup,Example of grooming as a reinforcer - Dog Training by Kikopup,"This is an example of how through training, you can change your dogs emotional response to something.  By conditioning the blow drier with something the dog really likes in small successful steps, you can see he now just likes the blow dryer experience so much he would come running when he hears it turned on.  A lot of trainers say, don't use your recall if you are going to groom your dog, because it will ruin your recall.  But I say if your dog LOVES grooming, then do!  Everything is subjective.  A lot of people think petting is a reinforcer for dogs, and will pet them after they sit for example.  Some dogs do indeed like petting, but a lot of dogs without prior training, find petting aversive or at the very least, not worth working for.

GBP0IDEN9EA,Dog Training by Kikopup,How to teach your dog to WAIT for the CUE,"Teach your dog to wait for the cue. In this 2 minute dog training video tutorial, I will show you how to train a ""default wait for a cue""  which I show attendees at my seminars.  Teaching this behavior will clean up your training greatly and it's a tip that is too important for it not to be publicly accessible.  Some dogs you will not need to work on this behavior, because they do it naturally.  But other dogs, when feeling frustrated or excited, might offer random behaviors to you while you are busy getting treats out of your pouch, or thinking about what you are going to do next and those behaviors accidentally get reinforced, so the dog can start to create a habit of offering random behaviors any time he doesnt know what to do.  You can create clarity to your training by teaching your dog what you want him to do when waiting for you to stop fumbling around.  Knowing what you want him to do will decrease frustration and confusion.   Happy Training!  Don't forget to give me a thumbs up for my work, comment and subscribe it you are a fan. :)

OPQFRs4tLiQ,Dog Training by Kikopup,"Wish says ""No"" - Giving dogs a choice -  professional dog training","Wish created a way to tell me ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. It started with a small head turn away from me, and when I ignored it by accident, she offered the behavior of turning away from me and sitting pretty as she does in this video. I never taught her to turn away from me as a trick before she offered it‚Ä¶ only previous training she had was to sit pretty facing me. As she was growing up, she would become worried in many social scenarios (pretty much ANY social scenario- after greeting a woman as a puppy and receiving a treat from her the woman touched her back as she was eating the treat and it frightened her so much she refused to take treats from hands for weeks‚Ä¶ even my own hand‚Ä¶), even when we were training. When I raised criteria too quickly or added a new cue‚Ä¶ she would sometimes become worried, even scared, and wouldn‚Äôt want to train anymore‚Ä¶ I started to give her a treat when she turned away. And what happened is, instead of wanting to give up, she would just tell me ‚ÄúNo‚Äù by turning and I would reinforce her, then I would lower criteria, and she would be back in the game. I soon figured out the triggers that made her uncomfortable, one of them being working with my other dogs, or being near other strange dogs. I learned to break things up in steps so she wouldn‚Äôt tell me ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. She gets immediate reinforcement (a treat or a toy) any time she tells ‚ÄúNo‚Äù by turning her head or turning her back on me to sit pretty, can you believe, after this video where she is 9 months old (where I intentionally pushed her a little so I could get it on film- which at the time I felt a little guilty for) she has only offered the ‚ÄúNo‚Äù behavior 3 times‚Ä¶ And it‚Äôs been a year since the last time‚Ä¶ Sometimes she works 3 minutes for a treat or toy, if she were to just say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù she could make me feed or play with her. But she doesn‚Äôt. This type of magic of communication between species is what makes me so excited about training dogs. When I was a little kid I read Doctor Dolittle books‚Ä¶ and was sad that communicating with animals was as fake as tooth fairies. When I learned how much dogs can communicate with use and us with them‚Ä¶ I devoted my life to it.

I didn‚Äôt consciously set about teaching her to say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, I wish I could give myself the credit for that idea‚Ä¶ But the idea was Wish‚Äôs, I just reinforced it. I later found out that Ken Ramirez- animal training genius and god‚Ä¶ Does teach animals to say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù in order to give them a choice and ultimately solves the training issues that were going on and my mind was blown once more‚Ä¶

pvRWltx5DnY,Dog Training by Kikopup,Sustained targeting meditation - Dog Training by Kikopup,"Here is a video of Wish at 9 months working on sustained targeting.  Sometimes trying to teach dogs concepts like duration when they are very excited can backfire causing the dog to feel frustrated while learning the behavior, and then down the line the dog can act frustrated while doing the behavior.  I suggest first teaching the concept of duration to your dog while he is in a calm state of mind.  Most trainers use food to teach concepts and precision before then building enthusiasm using toys.  If you have a dog who only works for food, you can use calm markers that predict calm slow treat deliveries... as apposed to arousing markers that predict arousing treat deliveries, like the treat being tossed.

ff59EjL2jWk,Dog Training by Kikopup,Using calm markers to teach precision in heelwork - Dog Training by Kikopup,"I will soon be releasing an article about the use of multiple markers in training, based on my presentation for the Art and Science of Animal Training Conference last year.  https://www.artandscienceofanimaltraining.org/conference/2018-program/multiple-markers/ This is one of my videos that I showed at the conference as one of the examples of the benefits of creating markers that have different meanings to the animal.  Here you can see, I am using errorless learning to proof ONLY the head position of Wish for heelwork (I have her target her feet two platforms so that I can get her back feet in perfect position.  I go over this in my Weekly Puppy Insights. The reason she is on two platforms is to get her to line up her back feet perfectly so I can focus on her head position and not inadvertently reinforce her back foot movement)  In the video you can see that I use the calm marker ‚Äúgood‚Ä¶‚Äù to mean stay in the position the reinforcement will come, and it predicts a calm reinforcement delivery.  Then to end the behavior I use the marker ‚Äúget it‚Äù meaning, stop doing the behavior and collect the reinforcement yourself.

mrWInQlDv3s,Dog Training by Kikopup,Focusing on arousal level for flashy heelwork!  -  Dog Training by Kikopup,"Proofing Wish's head position for heelwork to music. I learned to focus on one aspect of heelwork at a time from two awesome trainers - Brigitte van Gestel and Anja Christiansen I'm also focusing on the perfect level of arousal without frustration which is extremely important to me. Wish is a good example of how you can have flashy speed and precision without over arousal or frustration.  Signs of over arousal and frustration include abnormal breathing, whining, barking, growling, showing the teeth, showing the teeth, chattering the teeth, moving the head around... and some dogs... biting at the handlers leg.

In this video I am doing a very simple trick that I use- teaching the dog to focus on the toy that will be the reinforcer, without frustration or over excitement... When that is possible, I then ask for focus in the behavior that will earn the same toy.  If your dog starts to get over aroused and frustrated stop, and break the steps up smaller to reduce the risk of the problem being more likely to happen in the future.

lyrSdMUHRqU,Dog Training by Kikopup,How to line up for a photo! -  Dog trick,"I've seen even the most positive trainer, resort to pushing and shoving their dog into a position to get a picture of their dog when they were stressed, say after a competition or trial. I suggest teaching your dog a cue to get your dog into the position you want!  This video goes over teaching your dog to line up next to you or next to another dog. Take care always when working with multiple dogs- If you are worried your dogs might feel uncomfortable around each other or you have no idea how they will act around each other with food, I suggest working with a positive reinforcement trainer at first, who will be able to read your dogs body language to make sure your dogs are comfortable.

I play frisbee with wish about 3 times a week, after a good 4 min warm up session and then do a cool down session.Then only play 3-5 mins or so. She is a good weight and goes on off leash walks daily and we work on other fun exercises to keep her fit during the week. I started letting her jump for the discs when she reached 24 months.  I rarely let her jump for the discs because she jumps so darn high.","['Dog training', 'dog tricks', 'canine freestyle', 'clicker trianing', 'clicker training', 'positive', 'reinforcement', 'frisbee', 'disc', 'canine', 'dancing dog', 'dog dancing', 'dog trainer', 'professional', 'catch', 'standing up', 'back feet', 'catch a frisbee', 'dog videos', 'trick dog', 'trick dogging', 'dog training videos', 'dog trick videos', 'dog tricks videos', 'youtube dog trainer', 'youtube dog training', 'Border Collie tricks']",2018-03-11T00:33:31Z,PT46S,hd,false,4591,132,0,12
MtzZRmOKp7U,Dog Training by Kikopup,Kikopup trick for teaching SPIN on only verbal cue,"Teaching dog tricks is fun!  This video goes over teaching SPIN on a verbal cue!

A lot of handlers struggle to get their dog to ""offer"" certain behaviors on just a verbal cue, and Spinning in a circle is one of them.  My trick to getting the ball rolling is to first get the dog to offer spinning around a cone without a hand signal before seeing if the dog can offer spinning without the cone.  This trick with the cone is also great for dogs who are shy or nervous and do not want to spin away from you.","['Dog training', 'Clicker Training', 'Errorless learning', 'Dog Tricks', 'Trick Training', 'Dogs', 'Terrier', 'Kikopup', 'Dogmantics', 'relationship-based', 'Spin', 'verbal cue', 'Canine Freestyle', 'Dog Dancing', 'Dog training videos', 'dog training youtube videos', 'youtube dog trainer', 'emily larlham', 'dogmantics', 'kikopup', 'terrier training', 'Teach spin', 'trick training', 'Dog tricks', 'dog trick training videos', 'how to train a dog', 'cone', 'fun', 'dog training spin', 'dog trick spin', 'dog tricks spin', 'dog trick tutorials']",2018-03-08T18:46:13Z,PT1M16S,hd,false,12435,185,0,16
jwQfW54Yh8s,Dog Training by Kikopup,What to do in FIRST training session of LURING a PUPPY! - Puppy Training by Kikopup,"I train luring as a behavior, similar to targeting.  For me it is extremely important to prevent frustration and over-arousal during the training process.  If you lure your puppy for too long or hold the lure too close to the puppy where he thinks your actually giving him the treat... It can cause frustration and if your puppy is constantly frustrated/over-excited, it can lead to the dog being frustrated or over excited when performing the behaviors you train in this way.  That is why I think it is extremely important to train luring as a behavior- beginning by first having the puppy or new adult dog follow the lure from a distance with the correct level of arousal.  Make sure your dog has a closed mouth and is not acting frantically.  You can experiment holding the lure higher up and from a few feet away.  As your dog starts to understand the concept he is being reinforced for following, you can then add more advanced concepts to luring.

GZ-ZKpk6RQk,Dog Training by Kikopup,Splash's Dance Trick - Canine Freestyle Dog Tricks Tutorial,"I got a lot of requests recently on how to teach Splash's dancing trick! So here you go! Basically it's a trick the talented trainer from Spain Julia Faci created with her dog Nena and that Splash and I had put a little twist of our own on to make it look a little different. Now Wish is 18 months and her hip X-rays came back looking great so I thought I would make a video tutorial for you guys, using Wish as she is just beginning learning tricks while standing up. As I say in the video it's important to warm your dog up before training, train on a non-slip surface and listen to your dog - don't pressure your dog if he doesn't want to stand up for some reason. Dogs might refuse to stand up because they are feeling pain or discomfort. With all standing up tricks, it's important to do short training sessions ending before the dog feels tired, and not have your dog stand up for extended periods of time. If your dog is over weight, have your dog at the correct weight first and physically fit before training this trick. Its a good idea to get a physical therapist to give you advice on whether this trick will be ok for your dog to do. Here is a link to how to begin steps to training the initial footwork for the trick using the rear end awareness exercise- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEqQDw8Jo9M

Training manners can sometimes get put on the back burner when there are so many other things to do and train. The idea behind this program is to motivate not just pet dog owners but also trainers and those competing in sports to work more on their dog‚Äôs manners. Working on manners in training sessions instead of just managing the situations as they happen makes living together more enjoyable and less stressful for both dogs and humans.

Here is a list of the 20 tutorials:
    Take treats nicely - FREE SAMPLE 
    Teach your dog how to ask for something he wants in a polite way
    Door manners ‚Äì Getting ready for an outing
    Wait on a loose leash or near you off leash after exiting the car
    After being called, stay with you until released
    Doggie dinner manners
    Manners when humans cook and eat dinner
    Manners while playing tug
    Loose leash walking obstacle course around food and toy    distractions
    Manners while playing fetch
    Lay on mat with distractions
    Caf√© manners
    Drop whatever you have in your mouth
    Waiting for the traffic light and crossing the road
    Pass dogs and people on a walk as a training setup
    Greeting people politely

tVivnOwiMoA,Dog Training by Kikopup,Teach your dog to DROP - Dog Training by Kikopup,"In this free dog training tutorial, I will show you a technique I learned many years ago from my friend and dog trainer Kate Palese, for how to train a dog to quickly spit out the toy in his mouth.  By training at the correct level of arousal and using errorless learning, you can condition the dog to drop a toy faster than lightening.  I have not yet found a better way to teach such a clean and precise drop as of yet.  

Once the behavior is trained, you can then use getting to play with the toy again as a reward.

If you have a very fearful or aggressive puppy please seek the help of a professional trainer who doesn't use physical or psychological intimidation to train.

It is very important for your puppy to feel comfortable with being caught or grabbed when loose.  At some point in your puppy‚Äôs life, he might be loose and someone might be trying to catch him, if he got lost for example.  A lot of dogs without previous training, will be scared if a stranger tries to grab at their neck or harness and will run away, making it very hard to catch the dog, and potentially dangerous.  Other dogs might bite the person‚Äôs hand out of fear.   

We can teach puppies and dogs to feel comfortable and trust us when we grab their collar.

If your dog is aggressive, has bitten, doesn't like being touched, or you are simply worried to touch the dog's collar, get help from a professional dog trainer who uses positive reinforcement first.","['Dog Training (Literature Subject)', 'Dog (Domesticated Animal)', 'Puppy', 'Dogs', 'safety', 'biting', 'bite', ""don't"", 'stop', 'clicker training', 'positive reinforcement', 'kikopup', 'how to train', 'husky', 'siberian', 'border collie', 'behavior', 'collar', 'lead', 'problem', 'dog', 'training', 'train', 'mouthing', 'stop biting', 'dog training videos', 'dog training youtube', 'dog trainer youtube', 'husky training', 'poodle training', 'dog training tips', 'dog training collar', 'tutorial', 'how to', 'dog training tutorials']",2015-12-14T16:47:56Z,PT5M22S,hd,false,75318,945,0,85

In this video we put our own little twist on David and Skidboot's EPIC ball routine. David trained his dog to only get his ball when he said Three and no other number.  It was such a clever trick we decided to do it to!  Splash the Border Collie is in my opinion one of the most intelligent dogs in the world, so I figured she would pick the trick up quickly. We‚Äôve practiced it for about 4 days and she‚Äôs now got it, that she can only get the ball when I say Three.  She prefers not to play with the ball on her own at the end but be told what to do with the ball. She also really likes it when I tell her I am going to grab her feet, so that is also part of the reward.

You can see David and Skidboot here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2BfzUIBy9A  Just a warning, you will need to get some tissues ready for the end of the video. 

Splash is trained without any forms of physical or psychological intimidation, meaning I never pressure her to have to do anything, I always train her to WANT to do what I want her to do.

This technique needs to be used in conjunction with other techniques.  It doesn't teach your dog to walk on a loose leash, it teaches your dog to show impulse control and not forge ahead after receiving reinforcement when training on a walk.

You can teach your dog to wait until released through a door with the cue of the door opening and you can also add a verbal cue.  The benefit of the door opening being a cue to wait until released is a useful safety behavior, for example if you live on a busy street.  

Teaching a default wait is in no means an excuse not to take the proper safety precautions, for example having a double gate if you live by a busy road or having your dog on leash when the door is open.

852vp3tm2ms,Dog Training by Kikopup,Weekly Inspirations! - Year Long Dog Training Membership Program!,"Purchase a membership here:  http://dogmantics.com/product/weekly-inspirations-membership/

The Goal:
It‚Äôs important to be inspired. The goal of the Weekly Inspirations Program is to inspire you to train your dog something new each week. This program is unique in that each 4 week period, we will cover 4 different exercises in video tutorials:

Trick tutorial ‚Äì to build your training skills and your dog‚Äôs learning skills.
Focus game ‚Äì to build your dog‚Äôs interest in you and training.
Body awareness trick tutorial ‚Äì to build your dog‚Äôs body awareness, balance, coordination, strength and flexibility while exercising his mind.
Proofing game ‚Äì to teach you how to create reliable behaviors and take your training to the next level.

This 52 week program is designed not only for dog lovers who just want to have fun and bond with their dog through weekly training exercises, but also for dog trainers and those competing in dog sports to use as a tool for cross training, or in other words a tool for adding variety to their training.

The hardest part of adding variety to training is thinking up what to train and when. We will do it for you. Providing a year‚Äôs worth of inspirations.

13 Trick tutorials, 13 Focus games, 13 Body awareness exercises, and 13 Proofing games!

Because of the way that the program is constructed, there is always the possibility of skipping a week and not getting left behind, this way, if you and your dog‚Äôs life gets hectic or you need to focus on training that is more specific to your goals, you will not get left behind as the weeks progress.

The benefits:

*Provides mental stimulation.
*Sharpen your training skills.
*Sharpen your dog‚Äôs learning skills.
*Add variety to your training plan.
*Increase your dog‚Äôs body awareness, balance, coordination, strength and flexibility.
*Take the pressure off! This isn‚Äôt a competition. It‚Äôs meant to be fun for you and your dog.   If you are not having fun with a certain learning game or trick, skip it! You can always try it again later, no pressure!

How it works:
By paying the one time membership fee of 150$, you will be granted access to the Weekly Inspirations section of the Dogmantics.com website. Each week, for 52 weeks, a video tutorial will be posted. Each four week period will contain a video trick tutorial, focus game, body awareness trick tutorial and a proofing game.

The first tutorial will be posted 28th of February 2015. Then every Saturday at 8am Pacific Time a new video post will be added to the ‚ÄòWeekly Inspirations‚Äô members section of the Dogmantics.com website until the 52 weeks have passed.

Once all 52 video tutorials have been posted, the videos will remain on the website for two years after the program‚Äôs start date for your future reference. This is also so that people who sign up later, can have access to the videos for a full year.

The video tutorials are created by the trainers of Dogmantics Dog Training- Emily Larlham (AKA Kikopup) and Martina Sunnas. Emily and Martina will take turns instructing as well as doing joint tutorial videos.

The tutorials will be released weekly but we will release the subjects of future tutorials as we go, 8 weeks at a time.

Here is the plan for the first 8 weeks of the program:

Week 1 ‚Äì Trick tutorial Paws up
Week 2 ‚Äì Focus game Proofing attention with thrown treats
Week 3 ‚Äì Body awareness trick tutorial Stationary Weave
Week 4 ‚Äì Proofing game Proofing the release cue with words

Week 5 ‚Äì Trick tutorial Bang
Week 6 ‚Äì Focus game Toss the treat motivating game
Week 7 ‚Äì Body awareness trick tutorial Back up
Week 8 ‚Äì Proofing game Cue discrimination

Difficulty level:
These video tutorials are designed to be easy to understand for those with a very basic knowledge of Clicker Training. However, for the trick tutorials, we also add ideas of variations of the behavior at the end of the video or written description for those who want a challenge or who have already trained that specific behavior already. For example, in the free video sample of the ‚ÄòPaws Up‚Äô tutorial, those who have yet to train the trick can just work on teaching their dog the beginning steps to teaching the dog to put their paws up. Those who are more advanced can work on the different ideas of adding a twist to the behavior, such as the dog staying with his paws up no matter what the distraction, or looking left and right while in the paws up position. The tutorials will cover the steps of how to train the behavior in detail. The ideas of how to add a twist or increase difficulty will just be listed

This exercise is meant for young puppies who do not guard chews as a way of preventing them from thinking to guard chews in the future.  Some puppies, start off not guarding food, but by having their chew taken away many times by people, the puppies start learning to guard.  In this exercise we are teaching the puppies to drop a chew on cue. This is useful if the puppy finds something they shouldn‚Äôt have, or you need to take a chew away from the puppy because it is getting too short. 

This exercise is not meant for puppies who guard or adult dogs.  For puppies or adult dogs who guard as well as guard severely, a plan cantered to that dogs specific needs should be created.  If you have a puppy or dog with severe guarding issues, I suggest getting help from a professional trainer who doesn‚Äôt use any forms of intimidation, to help set up a counter conditioning plan for your specific dog.","['resource', 'guarding', 'guard', 'prevention', 'puppy', 'puppies', 'not', 'to', 'possession', 'food', 'chews', 'chew', 'sticks', 'how to', 'train', 'a dog', 'a puppy', 'positive', 'reinforcement', 'reward', 'dog', 'training', 'stop', 'counter conditioning', 'conditioning', 'aggression', 'Puppy training videos', 'dog training videos', 'dog trick training videos', 'resource guarding', 'correcting growling', 'youtube dog trainer', 'emily larlham', 'kikopup', 'dogmantics']",2015-02-21T06:28:54Z,PT3M58S,hd,false,51804,615,0,28

Puppy looks up happily, with soft eyes and relaxed expression

What are signs you are asking for too much too quickly:

Puppy freezes
Looks away without turning head, looks away, turns body away, moves away
Flattens
Stops chewing to give a hard stare
The whites of the eyes flicker
Tail wags frantically
Growling, whining, snarling 
Black pupils
Tense body muscles

bt_B-JwItMs,Dog Training by Kikopup,Splash learns to draw a circle - dog training smartest tricks,"Splash is the first dog to draw a circle with a pen in her mouth. We have not yet got the behavior reliably as that involves muscle memory and practice (think of how long it takes humans to learn to draw a perfect circle), but here are our beginning steps.  We are in the process of working on other shapes as well.  Stay tuned! Splash is one of the smartest dogs in the world - if not the smartest, every day she blows my mind.  We train without any forms of intimidation (we don't use any NRM or corrections- for example I never tell her ""wrong"", ""incorrect"", ""eheh"" or ""no""), in fact, I sometimes reward ""mistakes"" as usually it was something I did that prompted them. That said, we seem to be able to get some of the most precise behaviors out there. Playing training games with Splash is like living in a dream where animals understand what you want from them and can talk back to you.  I have learned to read Splash so well, I see all her tiny little emotions, and thoughts shine through her face.  She is the most sweet and tender dog, and can also read how I am feeling more than any human being I know, even my close family and friends.

XaNFY7jO6h4,Dog Training by Kikopup,Puppy Safety - Every owner should know this - Puppy Dog Training,"This is a very important topic for me. Puppies are not made of glass but we need to take care when we are training them, and when they are interacting with the environment and other dogs.  

Safety tips:

‚Ä¢Warm up and cool down- take short walks before and after   training.
‚Ä¢Work  and play on non-slip areas- grass padded flooring and carpet --not slippery floors
‚Ä¢Teach your puppy not to jump up for things you are carrying.
‚Ä¢Work on behaviors and tricks that build muscles equally on either side of your puppy's body (If you are going to teach attention heeling, teach it on the left AND right side of your body, and spin left and right etc)
‚Ä¢Make sure your puppy is not sitting on one hip or rolled onto his butt when training behaviors involving sitting.
‚Ä¢Reinforce calmer movements, rather than chaotic ones.

_PEt3vPXX6Q,Dog Training by Kikopup,Puppy Dog Tricks!,"Lumos the Border Collie puppy will blow your mind with his amazing tricks and melt your heart with his sweet personality.  This video is a compilation of the amazing tricks and behaviors he has learned from 8 weeks of age to 10 weeks.  This video is made to not only show how intelligent dogs are, even at such a young age, but also to encourage people to train without any forms of physical or psychological intimidation.  
The key to achieving so much so quickly is raising criteria appropriately and creating variety in training.  Lumos was trained 1-3 times a day for 2-10 minutes. (Obviously the socialization and going to lots of places, feeding for being calm and relaxed was the most effort!!!)  

LUMOS DID NOT REPETITIVELY DO THESE BEHAVIORS!  REPEATING THE SAME BEHAVIORS REPETITIVELY WITH PUPPIES CAN BE BAD FOR THEM.  I will make a video after this one on how to work on multiple behaviors so that your puppy is only doing a very few repetitions of each behavior, instead of obsessively drilling puppies on the same trick over and over.  An example being fetch:  the puppy spent training sessions learning to hold the object, and follow Martina backwards with it.  Then in 3 weeks there were only 2 training sessions where the puppy retrieved the object, 3 times one day and 4 times a week and a half later.  With editing people THINK the puppy is constantly doing all these tricks on the same day and repeating them all every day, but this is not the case. In the three weeks we have had our puppy he did backing up in 1 training session, and then was filmed backing up the next day.  He learned backwards circles in 1 training session, and then we filmed it the next day.  WE DID NOT WORK ON BACKING UP OR BACKWARDS CIRCLES EVERY DAY.  So please stay tuned for our coming videos on how to make sure you are not being repetitive with your training exercises.","['tricks', 'trick', 'amazing', 'talented', 'positive', 'reinforcement', 'Puppy (Animal)', 'Animal (Film Genre)', 'Misa Minnie', 'Puppy', 'worlds smartest puppy', 'trick training', 'worlds smartest dog', 'aww', 'too cute', 'Dog Tricks', 'Dog Training', 'Pet training', 'pet tricks', 'Puppy dog tricks', 'border collie', 'cutest puppy', 'dog videos', 'funny dog videos', 'dog training videos', 'dog trick videos', '10 weeks', 'amazing dog', 'smart dog', 'well trained', 'amazing training', 'puppy love', 'dog tricks', 'Lumos', 'puppy tricks', 'dog trick']",2014-04-21T03:38:30Z,PT4M59S,hd,false,97787,1567,0,144

I am picking up a puppy for my spouse. Our puppy's name is Lumos.  The breeder is socializing the puppies to all different kinds of surfaces and noises.  Sit back and enjoy watching with me!  Puppies need to be socialized to all the different environments, sights, sounds, and smells that they could possibly encounter in their lifetime during their most important socialization period.  The benefit of socializing the puppies while still at the breeders is the puppies still have the support of the litter and the parents, and breeder.  The time at the breeders is also during the most important socialization period. Proactive training and socialization prevents so many problem behaviors down the line.  You can help your breeder by volunteering to help with the puppies socialization.","['puppies', 'playing', 'socialization', 'dog', 'training', 'puppy', 'border collie', 'breeder', 'clicker', 'counter', 'conditioning', 'positive', 'reinforcement', 'reward', 'based', 'weeks', '7 weeks', '8 weeks', 'breeding', 'pedigree', 'classical', 'habituation', 'socilize', 'play']",2014-03-28T08:37:48Z,PT1M41S,hd,false,32988,433,0,60

IQUerO0woqw,Dog Training by Kikopup,Teach Sit Pretty,"Dog tricks Sit Pretty - The trick 'Sit Pretty' is one of my favorite exercises to teach dogs.  It is not only an adorable trick, but it has many benefits that make it a must to train.  Teaching 'Sit Pretty' increases your dog's balance and body awareness.  It also builds your dogs core muscles which protect the spine from injury during dog sports or playing fetch.   'Sit Pretty' is a trick for healthy dogs.  If your dog has pre-existing injuries, consult a physical therapist to inquire if this trick is safe for your specific dog.  

Most dogs do not have the muscles to be able to sit pretty without support, and it can take 2 weeks to over a month to build the muscles.  To do this you can practice short sessions of 'Sit Pretty' daily until your dog builds up the balance and strength to hold the position.

EITYvqs32Hg,Dog Training by Kikopup,How to train Upside Down Settle,"I was requested to make this video after creating a video showing how I trim my dogs' nails.  This video goes over how to I teach what I call the Upside down Settle, that can be used for many situations.  The key concept behind this position is that the dog can get up whenever he wants, and if he does, it simply means you have to go back a step and work where the dog is comfortable.  Some people might think that dogs do not like being on their back, but you can condition them to relax and feel comfortable in this position, making it less stressful for them in those situations where they have to be upside down- for example at the vet to get a urine sample done, or if they might have ran through a cactus, or have a wound to be treated on their underside.  Teaching your dog to do the Upside Down settle also is helpful for grooming- nail trimming, brushing, and checking your dog after walks for burs or sores.  Another great benefit is that you teach your dog to trust you.  So if you have a dog that is very shy to be on his back, I suggest take the time, and take it slow to build your dogs confidence in you so that in those emergency situations your dog can feel more relaxed.

I not only like to work on behavior modification but also activities with dogs that are very arousing- Canine Freestyle for example.  Because I also love to train my dogs to be calm and relaxed in social environments, I found that by choosing my markers wisely, I could really speed up the training process and get the best of both worlds- Calm when not 'working' or as I would call 'playing' and the right level of arousal during training.  This is another tip- your dogs cues can cause conditioned emotional responses too, so choose which cues you will use in different scenarios wisely! :)   

I know that you think I have forgotten about creating a video- teaching an upsidedown settle and a video on trimming black nails, but I am STILL going to do them!!! haha, I just dont have as much time as I hoped for, and this video was a lot quicker to edit.

7QqrmDJmNJk,Dog Training by Kikopup,Pose for the camera - Dog Tricks,"It is pretty easy to get your dog to look at a camera when you take the picture yourself, however, when you want to be in a picture with your dog, it can become a little tricky to get your dog to look at a distant camera person.   If you plan on winning competitions of agility, obedience or canine freestyle, teaching your dog to look at a camera is an essential skill.  Everyone loves taking pictures of their dogs, and also looking at pictures of their dogs.  If you are good at reading dog body language and facial expressions, it's easy to see how a dog is feeling by looking at the dogs picture.  If you use intimidation to train your dog to have his picture taken (stay or else)- your dog will have a stressed look on his face in the picture.  So the idea is, to get the dog to WANT to sit and have his picture taken, so that it is a fun experience for both the handler AND the dog, rather than JUST the handler getting a kick out of the picture taking session.  :) 

Respect the dog!  Teach them what you want, and teach them to LOVE doing what you want!

bpzvqN9JNUA,Dog Training by Kikopup,STOP barking at the door!,"This video goes over how to train your dog to stop barking at the door.

This video tutorial is for dogs who are friendly towards visitors coming into the house but bark at the door.  If your dog is fearful or aggressive towards strangers, DON'T do the exercises regarding people coming in your house, as this could actually send your dog over his threshold and make the problems worse.  For more information on training dogs that are fearful or aggressive towards people and dogs:

Check out the free videos on this subject on my website at:
http://dogmantics.com/free-video-list/reactivity-and-barking/

I also made a DVD on reactivity which you can find here:
http://dogmantics.com/product/reactivity-a-program-for-rehabilitation/

Another wonderful way of working with dogs who are reactive and aggressive is BAT - created by Grisha Stewart. Find out more here: http://functionalrewards.com/

------------------------------

Please, if you make your own dog training tutorials on youtube and use my ideas to base your videos on, please give me credit on my techniques. 

Stop barking at the door training tips:  Use the most reinforcing treats possible.  For example, real meat.  If you use low value treats, the training will not be as effective. 
 
It's better to nip the problem in the bud with 2 weeks of 1-3 minute training sessions every day and then touch up lessons,  rather than fooling around every once in a while when your dog starts to get on your nerves.


Prevent your dog from seeing and hearing the triggers outside of training sessions during the training process.
Figure out how to ""Change the picture"" to prevent your dog barking.
 
1 Meet guests outside with your dog on leash at a distance
2 Have your dog in a crate in another room with music on if you do not wish to work with your dog when guests come over.
3 Put a note on your door saying not to knock and instead call you.
4 You can be ready with treats and your dog on leash further away from the door for when the guest comes in.


If your dog barks:

1 Go back a step and set your dog up for success

2 Put less time between the trigger and feeding the treat

Splash the Border Collie wants revenge after a mean old man denied her of her Halloween treats.  After looking up the Halloween tradition of 'Trick or Treating', the dogs plan an array of mean tricks to punish the mean old man for not supplying halloween treats.   Splash the Border Collie teams up with her trusted side kicks- Kiko the Chihuahua, Tug the terrier, and Trisch the Podenco.   

DONT FORGET TO WATCH THE FIRST VIDEO IN THE SERIES!

AND THE SECOND!!!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwwTRwKPH_o

This video was made 3 years ago, but I had trouble with the music copyright which actually I do have the right to use as it is from the Apple program iMovie, which allows one to use the music in the way that I did in this video.  :) Sorry if you had seen this video before on my channel, but I personally think it's worth watching twice, especially before Halloween!!! :)  Which is actually my birthday. 

Sadly I was not able to make Halloween videos since Ive been in Sweden, as the star- Peter, the mean old man lives in California.  HOWEVER, next year most likely I will live in California again, and I will be able to make Halloween episode 4 which I am very excited about! :) Hehe.

Or you could train your dog never to go for dropped food only in the kitchen.  I like to toss food as a reward for my dogs when training complex tricks and obedience.  So I let them go for food that I throw during training sessions.  If you plan to NEVER let your dog go for dropped food, then when you are training you need to have a release cue like ""get it"" to mean your dog can go for the food you throw or you could ruin your default leave it from dropped food.  However most dogs are very smart and understand the situational cues.

F1DORI9bDBU,Dog Training by Kikopup,Splash the Border Collie's amazing dog tricks!,"Splash the Border Collie is the most amazing dog in the world.  My brother wrote the song in the video for her.  She is not only the smartest dog in the whole world, but the most caring dog I know.  Splash is always there for me when I feel down.  I train Splash and all my other dogs using Progressive Reinforcement Training, which means training without any forms of physical or psychological intimidation.  This means I always set the dogs up for success and when they fail, I know it is because I screwed up, so instead of telling my dogs ""no"" or ""eh eh"" I change the way I train so that the dogs learn correctly.  By doing this, my dogs can always choose not to do something.  But actually my dogs always choose to work for me (apart from one day when Splash was very ill and by her not wanting to do a trick I found out about her illness).  This way of training is very important when you train tricks, because if your dog feels pressured to do tricks because of social pressure, your dog might not ""tell you"" if a trick is causing him pain, or if you've asked for too many tricks in a row.  I believe this is the most ethical, safe and reliable way to train, not only for training tricks, but for behavior modification training.  Splash used to be highly reactive towards all humans and all dogs after being attacked by a dog as a puppy.  With time and effort Splash learned to first trust me, and then feel confident in herself.  Now she is a most wonderful, social dog.

Shy and Reactive Dog Training- 3 Calm Treat Deliveries

This is one video in a series of upcoming videos on how to help your shy or reactive dog to be calm and confident and solve their fear and arousal issues. 

These treat deliveries can be used for counter conditioning for shy and reactive dogs but also for training dogs that get over excited in training sessions.  These treat deliveries are also great for dogs that take treats hard when over excited- to prevent you being bitten. 

Note: In this video my dog is very close to things that previously my dog was nervous about in the past.  Use common sense, if your dog is scared of people or dogs, do not have your dog as close to the triggers as I have my dog in this video.  I will be uploading more videos on how to train your dog using counter conditioning.  If you wish to research more, there is a great book to read before you get started that is very short and to the point called Scaredy Dog by Ali Brown.  But a quick tip with working with fearful and reactive dogs is that you never want to work with them or have them in a situation where they are over their threshold,  you need your dog to be at a distance from the things that make him over aroused or scared where he is able to think and cope while training and managing your dog.  Check out my Barking series for more on counter conditioning.  For example this video on ""Barking On a Walk""

After retrieving hot dogs, I figured I'd take on the kibble challenge!!! This is Splash the BCs first lesson of holding kibble as well as going to put the kibble in a dish.  I plan to teach her to feed my dogs their dinner, to their bowl as a trick.  Tug also has never played a ""leave it , get it"" game before, so I thought I would do that just for fun.  I don't advice training leave it get it, as your dog could anticipate you saying get it, and go and eat the pills you drop on the floor....  So be warned!!! ‚ò∫

The Most Amazing Chihuahua Tricks Performed by Kiko- Clicker Dog Training Tricks

These are some of Kiko the world's cutest and smartest Chihuahua's favorite tricks!  Kiko is my heart dog, and I filmed some of her favorite tricks today because tomorrow she is going to have surgery to remove her right eye.  And so this will be the last footage of her with two eyes... I am very tearful about it.  But she has been suffering pain in the eye for so long and has been blind in the eye for many years.  It's time for the eye to be removed so that she will no longer be in pain.  Wish her luck with her operation tomorrow!  After she has recovered I plan to make more videos of my most special dog.","['dog tricks', 'chihuahua tricks', 'obedience', 'dog training', 'clicker training', 'canine freestyle', 'dog', 'trainer', 'most', 'amazing', 'tricks', 'amazing dog tricks', 'performed', 'by', 'kiko', 'Trick', 'Chihuahua (Animal Breed)', 'Dog (Organism Classification)', 'Dog Tricks', 'Amazing Chihuahua tricks', 'Chiwawa', 'Chihauhau', 'Chihuahua tricks', 'Chihuahua training', 'little dog training', 'toy dog', 'dog training videos', 'chihuahua dog tricks']",2012-05-09T00:38:47Z,PT3M15S,hd,false,52306,750,0,140

rjd99MlmqqI,Dog Training by Kikopup,"Teach ANY puppy to come when called! - come recall training, come recall fun and games!","In this video you will learn how to teach your new puppy to come running to you when you call him.  This is one of the most important cues you can teach your new dog.  It is one of the first behaviors you should start training your new puppy as soon as you get him! 

The Game Plan:
1 Make an attention noise, and click as your puppy comes towards you, then feed your puppy in front of you. 

2 Make and attention noise, then say your recall, and click the puppy for running to you, then feed your puppy in front of you. Click and feed your puppy for continuing to stay with you. 

3 Say your recall, click your puppy for running to you, and then feed the puppy in front of you.  Click the moment the puppy is running the fastest when she comes to you!

Problem Solving
Try different treats (we are using boiled chicken- a tasty and healthy treat for young puppies)

If the puppy is reluctant to come, run backwards, crouch, make exciting noises, pat your legs, or sit sideways.

Try a less distracting location

Use a long line attached to a harness for safety (NEVER attach it to a collar- it could cause severe neck injuries

Positive Interrupter Noise/Attention Noise-  
 

This is a noise that always sounds the same and means ""stop what you are doing and look at me"".  The difference between a recall and a positive interrupter is with a recall you want your dog to come running to you, while with the positive interrupter you want your dog to stop doing what he is doing, so you can give him an alternate behavior to do in place of the one you don't like.  An example: your dog is chewing on the wall; you can make a kissy noise and direct the dog to his chew toys.  
Having a noise that always sounds the same to get your dogs attention or interrupt 
unwanted behavior is easier to condition than using the dog's name.  I like to use a 
kissy noise or a whistle.  You can condition this noise to the point of muscle 
memory- red light stop, green light go, when you make the noise your dog stops what he 
is doing and looks at you reflexively. 

This noise is great for interrupting your dog from ""staring"" at other dogs or interrupt your 
dog from being spooked by another dogs staring.   If you were to say ""hey!"" or ""No!"" not 
only do you startle your dog while he is worried about the other dog (creating more 
tension and arousal) but you also ""pair"" punishment with the other 
dog, which is not a great way to make the other dog seem reinforcing! 

Video tutorial on how to teach the Positive Interrupter noise:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBvPaqMZyo8


 (Attention away from distractions shows up in the attention video at 4.15 mins into the video)

Exercise 1: Click your dog for voluntary eye contact.  Anytime your dog looks at you click and reward.  This is to condition looking at you to be reinforcing. 

Exercise 2: Condition your interrupter noise.  Make the noise (a kissy noise or a whistle), pause, and then move to feed your dog a treat. Do this until the dog is perking up when he hears the noise (similarly to a clicker), if your dog is not paying attention to the noise it could mean the treats you are using are not reinforcing or the dog is stressed or distracted by the environment).  You want to work on this very important behavior in a non-distracting environment to build a strong foundation before moving on. 

 Exercise 3: Make the interrupter noise and 'click' or say 'yes' for eye contact. If the dog doesn't look you can try making a blowing noise to get your dog to look up at you- don't actually blow at your dog or your dog might be tempted to bite at the air... you will be just making a strange noise to initiate eye contact that you can click.

Exercise 4: Next step, make the noise while your dog is looking the other way, CLICK when the dog orients towards you, and FEED. Don't forget you can also praise your dog after you click. You can ask for longer and longer periods of eye contact if you wish.  Once your dog is turning around every time you can click for eye contact rather than then initiation of the dog turning around. 

Exercise 5: Proof the interrupter noise by having the dog on leash and on a harness with a distraction ahead (perhaps a toy just out of reach, or a treat just out of reach) make your noise and CLICK when the dog turns their head to look at you. Once your dog is turning reliably you can click for the dog turning and then making eye contact.  You will find if you are doing it correctly, that the dog will seem to no longer want to pull towards the distraction, even avoid it.  Now start proofing with higher-level distractions, and proofing in different locations.  If for some reason the dog doesn't turn back towards you.  You can work more on conditioning the noise, as well as start off further away from the distraction.  If you make a mistake and start too close, simply back up, without jerking the dog, using gentle even pressure to move further away from the distraction to the point where your dog can be successful. 

Remember, don't ONLY make the attention noise around things your dog doesn't like or is fearful of, or you can poison the cue.  Your dog can learn to associate the noise with the ""presence of something he doesn't like"", so if you are using the noise for a shy or reactive dog make the noise to get your dogs attention away from food, smells and people or dogs he likes as well.

Puppy Leave It- Clicker Dog Training Tips

Kikopup spends nearly all of her time making free training videos and educating the public for free. If you would like to make a donation to support her work, simply go to the link below and click on the donate button. You can donate as little or much as you like. My dream would be to be able to support myself from creating free content that everyone around the world could access no matter what their situation! http://www.dogmantics.com/Site_5/Donate.html

Teaching 'Leave It' to a puppy is actually easier than teaching it to an adult dog.  Remember to continue to raise criteria as you go, puppies can figure things out as fast as lighting, and if you don't keep raising criteria as your puppy succeeds you will get trapped on the same level of behavior.  

Once your puppy can leave food in your hand on the floor, see if your puppy can leave uncovered food.  Then try different types of food, in different locations!  Add your cue!  Add distance!  Stay tuned for leave it series 3 where you will learn how to create distance as well as use the cue for other things such as leaving other dogs, people and other distractions besides food.","['Leave it', 'Leave it tips', 'Leave it alone', 'Dog training', 'Dog Trainer', 'Clicker Training', 'Dog Training Tips', 'Puppy Training Tips', 'Expert dog training tips', 'Professional Dog Trainer', 'How to train a dog to leave it', 'teach your puppy to leave it', 'Dog Training', 'Dog training tutorials', 'Puppy (Animal)', 'how to train a dog', 'how', 'to', 'teach', 'train', 'your', 'puppy', 'leave', 'it', 'alone', 'impulse', 'control', 'frustration', 'food', 'dog training videos', 'dog trick training videos', 'leave it command']",2012-03-01T12:40:13Z,PT1M1S,hd,false,71928,400,0,25

Train your puppy like a professional dog trainer.  Follow my tutorials and tip videos to get information that even your local professional dog trainer doesn't know about! 

This short tip goes over the concept of reinforcing the behaviors you like before your puppy learns on his own to find the behaviors you don't like reinforcing.

Teaching your dog to listen to you when he is playing is a very important skill and is a great tool for interrupting inappropriate play- such as over excited, aggressive, and annoying play.  You can interrupt play if one dog is not enjoying the play anymore.  Calling your dog away from another dog while they are playing is a great test to see if  the other dog really was enjoying playing with your dog, or feeling trapped.  If the dog comes back to play with your dog after you call your dog away, most of the time he is enjoying it.  If the dog stays away from your dog after you recall your dog- most likely the dog was hoping for a chance to escape the overwhelming experience.

This video goes over how you can use a marker word instead of using a clicker to train your dog.  Even if you do use a clicker with your dog, it is a great idea to have a marker word that works in the same way as the clicker for when you want to train when you forgot your clicker or perhaps you need both of your hands for other reasons.  I use a marker word very often to train new freestyle behaviors because either my hands need to be close to my dogs head or I am using both of them.  Using a marker word for handling is also a great idea, as you will need one hand to hold the treats and the other hand to touch the dog with.

This is a series of videos of the most important lessons to train your new puppy or dog. No matter what your dogs background the exercises and lessons I will post will build strong foundations to the most amazing and rewarding relationship that you could possibly imagine between you and your dog- and create strong, reliable behaviors to build upon.

My videos will cover not only training your dog with a clicker but also without a clicker so pay attention even if you are not interested in using a noise marker to train your dog. :)

Some of you might have seen this footage already- it is from the video ""What is Clicker Training?"" However I have gotten a lot of questions from people on how to start clicker training, so I thought I would make this part of the video into its own tutorial as so many people have requested the information and found it hard to find.

If you do not know what clicker training is, please watch my video!

Tip of the day- harness up - clicker dog training

This video shows how you can teach your dog to find their harness a secondary reinforcer by using the game of fetch.   Obviously if you have a puppy or a dog that is likely to chew on the harness before or after- don't use this behavior- or make sure you put the harness out of reach when not training so that your dog doesn't learn to chew on the harness.

Tip of the day- clicker dog training tricks

This video shows how you can soften kibble as well as flavor it to use as training treats that are very small and stay together.  Experiment with how much water you add to your kibble so that it is the right consistency for you.  It is also better for digestion, as eating dry kibble can suck moisture from the body when it is digested if the dog does not have water with the kibble.

I would just like to say to all those people thinking of re homing their dog because they are moving.  It IS possible to bring your dog with you!  Even if you have four.  Yes, it does take some preparation, stress and money, but not any more money than a medical issue might cost.  With training you can teach your dog to find the move low stress.

It is very common to have loose dogs run at your dog when you are in a public space where dogs are supposed to be on leash by law.  Sadly not all dogs can cope with a loose dog running at them while on leash, this video outlines the points of why you should be compassionate to not only the other dogs in public spaces but also your own.  As you can see you can train your dogs to ""cope"" with being trapped and approached by loose dogs.  But this video is mainly to teach people to be considerate of other dogs in your environment and help them out by setting them up to succeed.  Politely asking if your dog can 'say hi"" while you are 10-20 feet away, is a great way to begin letting your dog greet a strangers dog.","['dog', 'training', 'Dog Training', 'Clicker', 'Clicker Training', 'puppy', 'off', 'leash', 'recall', 'reliable', 'positive', 'reinforcement', 'clicker', 'reward', 'reward-based training', 'tip', 'tips', 'tutorials', 'tutorial', 'video', 'videos', 'off leash dogs', 'considerate owner', 'dogs on leash', 'dog training', 'dog training videos', 'dog behavior videos']",2011-10-23T21:10:27Z,PT1M19S,hd,false,18263,275,0,72

Great training can make any dog look brilliant and this seminar will also help you create a great bond and excellent skills around the house, too!

Z6nQs2xyyDU,Dog Training by Kikopup,Dog Tricks- Double Dog Tricks Funny,"to use Progressive Reinforcement Training. :)  A respectful way to train your companion animals...

The Need for a New Term:


A type of animal training exists that involves no forms of intimidation, confrontation, violence, reprimands, or domination.


This non-violent type of training has gone under many names: ""Clicker Training,"" ""Positive Training,"" ""Positive Reinforcement Training,"" and ""Reward Training,"" among others.   There is a need for a more specific, more accurate, more inspirational term.  The above terms have been used so loosely in recent years that they have lost their original meanings.  How has this happened?  Trainers who use compulsion methods may incorporate a clicker (a noise maker to mark desirable behavior) and refer to themselves as a ""Clicker Trainers.""  Trainers who use painful or intimidating methods may include food or toy rewards in their training and refer to themselves as ""Reward Trainers"" or ""Positive Reinforcement Trainers.""  It is already possible that a member of the public may seek the guidance of a trainer who claims to be ""Positive,"" only to find out that this trainer routinely uses physical violence towards animals.


I propose a new term that trainers and members of the general public can use to refer to this type of modern training -- a training system that is not only humane, compassionate, and reliable, but is also based on the latest scientific studies.  Because this form of training constantly incorporates the latest and most reliable scientific findings, and because it furthers an evolutionary progress toward a more harmonious relationship between humans and the animals who live with them, it shall be referred to as Progressive Reinforcement Training.


Progressive Reinforcement Training essentially means teaching animals by rewarding desired behaviors and excluding the intentional use of physical or psychological intimidation.

All my dogs are only trained using Progressive Reinforcement Training.

The dogs featured in this video belong to my friend youtube user: alomaro

There is a myth going around that is not founded in science, but is mere opinion, that high drive dogs need to be physically and psychologically intimidated in order to be trained.  By using Progressive Reinforcement Training which involves no forms of physical or psychological intimidation, you can train high drive dogs the right level of arousal as well as reliable behaviors, and how to be friendly and calm around other dogs and people.

F5FF6iqrbJs,Dog Training by Kikopup,Turn lights on and off - dog tricks,"Splash and Kiko were trained to turn the light switches on and off using Free Shaping.  In this video I wanted to show that you can use Luring to achieve complex behaviors in a rapid amount of time.  Tug already has the skills of fading a lure and adding a verbal cue under his belt.  But I have to say that all this footage was taken from a single training session of 10 minutes long.  When using free shaping getting to this same level with the two behaviors of ""push"" and ""off""- it took a few more training sessions and I found it harder with dogs that liked to retrieve as they would keep offering trying to put the light switch in their mouth like a dumbell.  

Hope you have fun with this one!  The key is to keep raising criteria quickly!!! DONT get trapped on the luring stage!!! The luring stage should only last a couple of minutes until your dog is reliably making sweeping movements to confidently turn the switch on and off. 

See you next time!

In fact children should never teach dogs tricks alone, and should be supervised at all times around dogs.  Remember!  ALWAYS use a TOY or soft object for this trick! The idea is to have fun with your dog in a SAFE environment.  NEVER swing an object at a dog without training the dog to feel relaxed and comfortable with the ""game""!  NEVER actually TOUCH the dog with the object in this video- if the dog doesnt want to jump, be patient and go back a step.  This trick is about teaching the dog to jump for the fun of it, like in agility, not to jump out of avoidance.

xEqQDw8Jo9M,Dog Training by Kikopup,Rear end awareness - the key to complex dog tricks,"This video goes over the steps of how to using LURING to train the Rear End Awareness exercise.  This is an exercise that is not only good for bodily awareness, and building muscles, but also a foundation behavior for teaching some very complex tricks.  The behavior can be free shaped as well, however I like to lure this behavior as I like to retain the hand signal that evolves from the luring action as the cue, to use later when teaching other behaviors that involve back foot movements. Its almost as though you magnetize the dog to line up with your hand... and I believe it is quite easy to make  side stepping behaviors  secondary reinforcers. 

I use a clicker in this video but if you do not have one you can say ""yes"" in the place of a click.

Clicker training is a way of training animals in which desirable behavior is marked with a sound maker and then reinforced, making the behavior more likely to happen in the future. Who can use clicker training? People of all ages!  What animals can be clicker trained? All animals, young or old.  All species and breeds, small or large.  Clicker training creates strong reliable behaviors, and is a great way of modifying behavior- solving shyness, reactivity and aggression.  It is also a ethical way to bond with your companion animal as you train the animal to want to do what you want them to do, rather than physically or psychologically intimidating the animal to do what you want.

Vk4PPcE1CqY,Dog Training by Kikopup,"The BEST and FASTEST way to teach STAY - stay training, stay fun!","Training your dog to stay using this method incorporates many wonderful concepts into the training process:

1-By click as distractions happen you are using classical conditioning to change your dog's emotional response to being calm and relaxed around those distractions.  Lowering a dogs stress levels when asked to stay, which in turn will make the behavior more reliable.  The distractions become conditioned secondary reinforcers.  

2- By teaching the release cue first, you are using 'back chaining' by working on the end of the behavior of the stay first.  Back chaining creates strong behaviors.

3- You are using the Premack Principle: the higher probability behavior predicts a lower probability behavior.  Staying predicts getting up and getting to do what the dog wanted to do. Meaning the behavior will be stronger. 

4- By clicking the release as a behavior it becomes a secondary reinforcer.  So every time you release your dog from a stay, you are actually rewarding him for staying.

Splash is demoing how she generalizes don't step off the grass in two locations where I have never trained her to do it.  I only trained her in front of my house, and another location, but as you can see she generalized it to the canyon area near the park because it doesnt have 'grass' (or at least that is what I think).  The day that I film this I actually WANTED her to go and get the frisbee for me when I did a crappy throw, but she would not leave the grass,  and I had to go and walk my lazy self down there in the bushes to get the frisbee.  I was very impressed with her generalization skills so I picked up the camera and filmed a ""fake"" bad throw.  However, with most dogs you would have to go to a few locations to train, before they would generalize it to all locations.

When you make the learning process a fun error-less learning process the dogs start to enjoy behaviors that could otherwise be very dull like heelwork.

wesm2OpE_2c,Dog Training by Kikopup,Capturing Calmness- how to train calmness in dogs,"This video is a tutorial on how to teach your puppy or dog to be calm. 

Some dogs need help to learn how to relax. Calmness does not come naturally to some breeds .By reinforcing your dog for being calm, your dog will start to choose calmer behaviors in the future and actually enjoy being calm. 

Tips for teaching a Default Settle:

Don't  drop treats if the dog looks up at your hand as you move to give the dog the treat, instead try again later.

Don't cue the dog ""down"".  It works better if the dog figures it out on his own and CHOOSES to lay down.

Use high value treats like real meat or cheese for such a wonderful behavior.

Dogs use their mouths to interact with their environment, so it is normal for a puppy to want to bite your hands or clothes.  However in our society it is highly inappropriate. To train a puppy to stop using their mouth when interacting with humans is simple.  All you have to do is set up training scenarios where your puppy would normally start biting and train an alternate response- calmly sitting, lying down, standing, or walking with a closed mouth.  First you would start with the least arousing game- so simply just a reaching hand.  As you reach, click or say ""yes"" and then feed a treat. As the puppy is successful you can progress to more and more arousing stimulus.

You should not allow your dog to be man handled or petted roughly.  Petting should not only be rewarding for the human but for the dog as well.  However at some point in your dogs life, someone might get to your dog before you can stop them and be overly rough. You can prepare your dog for these situations by playing training games.  But when these situations do occur  in real life, respect your dog, and get them out of the stressful situation.  Do practice handling exercises for grooming as well as vet visits regularly...

Tips-

These exercises should only be done by ADULTS.  As children can actually TEACH dogs to find mouthing and biting fun. 

If you want to work with your child as the distraction, have your puppy with you on leash while you control all interactions.  Making sure to end the game if the puppy is getting too aroused. 

 Children under the age of 5 should never be left alone with a dog or encouraged to interact with or pet dogs as they cannot control how rough they are and can make your dog learn to not like children as well as it being unsafe for the child.   

Put your puppy on leash and tether him to a door so that you can escape him if you make a mistake by progressing too quickly and elicit mouthing.

If your puppy starts mouthing you during the training games it means you have gone too far too quickly- go back a step and make the game easier. 

Make sure your puppy can always back away from you, so they don't feel trapped or forced when being handled. This is because they could start learning  to bite out of fear or stress.

If you have an adult dog or adolescent dog that is mouthy watch my Handling Shyness video.

If you must rough house with your dog- have a structured game where you hold a toy in each hand that the dog can bite. Never allow your dog to bite your hands when playing. If you feel teeth the game ends. Always have a cue to start and end the game, and never reinforce the dog for starting the game on his own.

If your puppy is very excitable, you could have your puppy on leash or in a pen while someone else does the distraction further away from you at first so that the puppy can cope.

For more information on reactivity check out my latest DVD:
http://dogmantics.com/product/reactivity-a-program-for-rehabilitation/


Step One- 

Click and feed your dog as he alerts towards the gate he usually barks at BEFORE he barks, and then walk the other way.  Repeat this step until he is no longer alerting.  You can also feed your dog for looking, instead of clicking.  However, if you do this and your dog turns around to look at the food, don't give it to him. You want the other dog to be the predictor of reinforcement, NOT your hand movement! 

Step Two- 

Walk closer to the gate or window that the reactive dog usually appears at and either feed the dog AS they are looking, or click the dog and feed.  Then walk away.

Step Three- 

Pass the house in an arc.  Walk your dog across the street so that he is as far away from the barking dog as possible as you both cross. As the dog begins to look confident and relaxed you can walk the dog in a closer arc.  Keep in mind to not walk TOO close to the other dog, as you don't want to cause it any undue stress! 

If your dog becomes reactive, simply say ""lets  go"" and go the other way (with NO TREAT).  Practice the cue ""lets go"" before using it with distractions.  If your dog keeps reacting make it easier for your dog, walk up to where he is comfortable, click and then turn back the way you came.

Step Four- 

When you have changed your dogs emotional response to dogs barking at fences, continue to give your dog information and feedback!
Walk past the barking dog, and tell your dog what a good dog he is for being so brave and relaxed. Remember you can use your voice and calm touch to tell your dog they are wonderful!  You can also use calming signals as you pass, to tell your dog you are not worried about the other dog.

Tips-

1- Use management and prevention.  Start practicing this exercise with the dogs that your dog has the lowest reaction to and then work up to the ones that he has the highest reaction to.  If that means driving past the house up the street and getting out to walk your dog, it's worth it!
 

2- If your dog recently reacted to another dog, when passing a house with a dog at the gate, go back a step and increase distance because your dog will be more likely to react. 


3- If you are not seeing improvement- try using better treats and try working from further distances first.  You can also practice just hanging out in front of your house, or practicing 'settles' with your dog on leash to help your dog be calmer when outside.

4-Don't leave your reactive dog behind a fence or window when you are not home- as they will learn to become reactive to other dogs.

This is the crazy idea I had one evening after a couple beers To make a Clicker Training commercial like the Amazon Kindle commercial.  Yes, I know I am a dork  
I know its a bad idea to post this on the web but whatever 
I wonder what other dorky dog trainers get up to if they have a night to themselves and a camera? 
I wonder if this video will nauseate people about clicker training or spark interest hmmm. I guess I just need to post it and find out 

So here are the silly lyrics I made to the Stole My Heart song by Marcus Ashley and Annie Little song in the Kindle commercial-

Once a upon, 
A time I found something that won,
My heart over. It changed my life,
And now I know I wont think twice.

I love my dogs cant you see, 
I trained them right in 123, 
I love my dogs, yes its true,
I changed my heart now Im going to change yours too!

xZCIeEUm_n8,Dog Training by Kikopup,Solving Counter Surfing -  Dog Training,"This is a video on how to train your dog not to surf the counters or in other words put their paws up and eat food and items that are on your counters.  
Remember to keep in mind that during training, items that your dog likes should NOT be left in reach on counters so that you don't UNDO all the training you have just been doing.  As nagging a turkey off the counter WILL train your dog to do it again! 

At the beginning of the video you will see Tug my new puppy BEFORE I trained him, he would jump up and onto tables to lick them clean.  At the end of the video you can see the results of one session that was a couple minutes long.  



Tips:
1- Make sure the dog NEVER gets the food- it sounds obvious but some dogs are very FAST!
2- If he is struggling to look away from the food, either give him a hint by making an attention noise or take some steps away so he is not as close to the food
3- As he succeeds raise criteria
4- You can start off first with a carrot on the table but the reinforcement is something even better like Chicken 
5- Watch my 'leave it' video for more information on teaching the leave it

These exercises are for all dogs, as most dogs do not like to be handled.  This video is the first in a series to come... 
I am sorry about the big block of text at the beginning of the video, but it is because this exercise needs to be taken seriously, as if done wrong you can scare a dog, and a frightened dog will bite, as will any animal that is frightened. 
If you are worried that your dog is too shy or frightened to work with, you can talk to an animal behaviorist first.  Another game you can do is just tossing the dog treats, and feeding the dog his meals by dropping the kibble for the dog following you.","['clicker', 'training', 'dog', 'shy', 'fearful', 'reactive', 'snappy', 'aggressive', 'dogs', 'obedience', 'conditioning', 'counter', 'handling', 'touching', 'bites', 'bite', 'Dog Training (Literature Subject)', 'Clicker Training', 'how', 'to', 'train', 'tutorial', 'tips', 'tip', 'confident', 'touch', 'bite inhibition', 'How-to (Media Genre)', 'positive', 'reinforcement', 'reward', 'reward-based', 'progressive', 'tutorials', 'a dog']",2010-04-27T06:03:37Z,PT7M53S,sd,false,115685,1002,0,79

lC_OKgQFgzw,Dog Training by Kikopup,STOP jumping up!,"This video goes over some simple exercises on how to teach your dog to stop jumping on you!  
Remember! Dogs jump for a reason!  It is either to get your attention, they are over aroused or stressed, or  to acquiesce to you (when the dog tries to get to your mouth to lick it)

Tips:
1-Teach your dog what you want them to do instead of jumping up FIRST
2- Don't reinforce jumping up with attention 
3- Proof by creating situations your dog will want to jump up in, so that the dog generalizes the behavior. 
4- Prevent jumping when you are not in the mood to train your dog, by having your dog on leash or in his pen

This is not only a great game to teach your puppy or dog how to learn to learn, but it is the foundation for many behaviors and tricks.  Tricks with this foundation include- wave, shake , high five, standing up, hands up,  close the door, cop cop, say your prayers, descrimination, freestyle foot work and more.
Check out zsianz1  's video on how to teach a high five using this technique! 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh5KmlooDac

Take care with large breed dogs or dogs who have sharp toe nails as you can get slapped. Perhaps teach shake down the line when you have more experience as a trainer so that your large dog doesnt learn to paw at you as their favorite behavior.  The great thing about the technique that I am using is that the dog isnt learning to paw at your skin, but at an object, so you can get that on stimulus control before it is just your arm (for very large and powerful dog breeds).  You can also click them fore being gentle before you switch to using  just your hand for shake.

For more information on reactivity check out my latest DVD:
http://dogmantics.com/product/reactivity-a-program-for-rehabilitation/

This dog training video outlines a plan for beginning to counter condition a dog to certain types of people that a dog becomes reactive to.  This video can also be used as a way to socialize young puppies to weird things in the environment.  Another useful application of these exercises would be for a dog and handler team practicing to take a Canine Good Citizen test, as well as proofing a Therapy dog or Service dog for all types of situations they might encounter while on the job. 

It is very common for dogs to become reactive to anything out of the ordinary.  We have selectively bred them to be this way.  

Many dogs will become reactive or show fear to stimuli such as a weird hat, a cane, a walker, a stroller, a person with bags, a big jacket, strange movement and anything that changes a persons profile.

You can set up training games to change your dogs emotional response from fear or arousal to calm friendliness using counter conditioning.  Watch this video to check out what you can do. 
--------
Another thing you can do to speed up the process, is to leave these scary items around in your house for the dog to habituate to and investigate.  You can also wear them.  If your dog is fearful of people with gloves, wear gloves when you watch TV in the evening every once in a while.  Put on a different scary item before you put down your dogs dinner bowl.   
-------
If at any point the dog were to become reactive, simply say 'let's go' to the dog, and when the dog has stopped reacting you can let them watch as their favorite person removes the object, and walks away from it.  You can then let your dog approach and check out the object on the ground to find out that is not dangerous. 
------
If you have a very shy or reactive dog, seek advice from an animal behaviorist, and during this exercise do not let the dog get within reach of the favorite person with the object, or they could get bitten. 
--------
For a doorway.  Have your dog on leash.

1- have the dogs favorite person enter and exit the doorway. Click or feed your dog for watching the person come in while the dog remains calm by your side
2- have the person come in pick up the hat or coat, and then put it on in front of the dog. 
3- have the person leave in the hat or coat, and then come back in the door seconds later. 
4- repeat with different scary items

k4LoPU1g310,Dog Training by Kikopup,Teach your dog not to pull - teach 'back up' for leash walking,"This is another cool Dogmantics Dog Training Tip on how to teach your dog to walk next to you on a loose leash.  

If you are consistent with this behavior, you can actually make pressure on the leash a CUE for the dog to back up and they learn to walk on a loose leash as a default.
=----
Teaching a dog to back up into the heel position on walks is helpful for many reasons.  

1- If you have more than one dog on a walk sometimes it can be hard to turn around and go the other way if both dogs are ahead of you.  Teaching them to back into the heel position allows you to move freely

2- If you train your dog that when he reaches the end of the leash the only way he can move forwards again is to back up, he will consciously start avoiding hitting the end of the leash. This means- No more pulling on leash.

3- This is a great impulse control exercise based on the Premack Principle. In order to move forwards you must first move backwards.

5Kt_pi1z1sA,Dog Training by Kikopup,Leash Walking Tip: Teach 'go sniff',"This exercise is great for dogs who are constantly crossing in front of their owners on walks to try to reach something to sniff.  
This video is also good for owners who have dogs who blow them off when they leave the house.  By controlling access to real life rewards you can build your importance to your dog when outside of the house.

Walks should not only be about exercise for dogs but about mental stimulation.  During a walk you can give your dog permission to go sniff so that they can explore an area while you follow behind keeping the leash loose.  When you are ready to move on, simply say Lets go and move on.  

For dogs that are markers you can teach them to walk by your side and then give them breaks to mark in appropriate areas.  When the dog is walking on a loose leash at your side if they try to mark on something quickly move on while saying lets go before they get a chance.  Then when you are at an appropriate area give your cue go sniff so they can sniff around and mark.  Or if you prefer you can teach your dog to pee on cue. 



By teaching your dog that you can reinforce them with access to the environment, you can get your dog to listen to you out of the house even when you have no toy or treats.

MgnLgHFRJu4,Dog Training by Kikopup,How to communicate with a dog in his own language,"In this video I will show you how you can use your dogs own language to communicate with them.  I will also show you how to interpret your dogs language.  

This video is about the secret language of dogs.  Some of you might already know about Calming Signals, but the main population that find out about dog training through Television programs might not. 

In no way do I condone pestering a dog in order to make them offer calming signals for you to see. I kissed Kiko on the head in this video to show her response, not that I want to condone it! ‚ò∫  Also certain dogs will like to be touched and kissed in different situations.  So you can tell if your dog is happy with the attention or not by their reaction. 

Dogs bite.  You should never put your face in a dogs face.  Calming signals can be offered when you are standing or sitting, I was very close to Splash at one point in this video because it was hard to fit us in the video screen, and Splash is very comfortable with me being that close to her face.  Never lean into a dogs face in order to communicate with them!  Its Threatening!

Turid Rugaas is an internationally renowned dog trainer who has studied and researched calming signals for over a decade!  You can visit her site on calming signals to learn more AND PICK UP ONE OF HER BOOKS AND DVDS on the subject.  
http://www.canis.no/rugaas/onearticle.php?artid=1

Here are the main calming signals that I like to use with dogs-

1 Soft Eye Blinks
2 Looking Away
3 Lip Licks
4 Yawning

1- You can use calming signals to calm a dog down and tell them ""no worries""
2- You can monitor your dog's calming signals and if they are doing more than normal you can tell your dog is getting more stressed (calming signals are normal and happen all the time)
3- If you pet your dog and they offer a calming signal that is normal, but Imagine this Scenario- a child pets a dog and he offers lots of calming signals, then the dog walks away from the child, and the parent brings the child to the dog again, and the dog offers even more calming signals and walks away to lie down, then the parent brings the child to pet the dog a third time, and finally the dog is so stressed that it growls, or bites.  The parent could have read that the dog did not want to be petted by the child more than that first time if they knew about calming signals.

Experiment with different shapes and sizes of container, remember never use glass or anything that could be potentially dangerous to the dog.  

This is a great way to RECYLCE!!!  Rather than just buying uneccessary plasic toys for your dog when you can make them with your recycling.

Some warnings
*Make sure you never leave the dog alone with the toy as they could eat the plastic to get to the food, this could be very dangerous!
*Be careful cutting with the scissors, dont cut towards yourself.
*Dont cut near your dog

mwDeqslHWbg,Dog Training by Kikopup,How to add a verbal cue - clicker dog training tutorial,"This is my dog training tip of the day for today.  It is a continuation of the last tip.  In this video you will learn how to add a verbal cue to a behavior that you taught with a hand signal.  


There are three easy steps to teaching a Verbal Cue:

Step 1: Give the hand signal 5-10 times to help the dog predict what you will ask next.

Step 2: Say the Verbal Cue BEFORE you move a muscle to do the Visual Cue

Step 3: Put time between your new Verbal Cue and your Visual Cue. Wait the dog out and see if they will offer the cue without the hand signal.



As you could see Kiko did not know what I wanted at one point, and offered another behavior besides the 'Spin'.  Instead of telling her she was wrong, I made a kissy noise and asked her to touch my hand to reset her.  If she had continued to guess incorrectly, I would go back a step and give her the 'Spin' hand signal again after saying the verbal cue.  The more you play this game the faster your dog will be at picking up new cues.  Kiko now knows after a few minutes, that 'Obama' is the new word for 'Spin'.  DOGS ARE SO SMART!

19SZTwQkpEw,Dog Training by Kikopup,Dog training Tutorial: Fading a Lure (while teaching SPIN),"This is a quick how to video I made for a youtube user who said they were having trouble getting rid of the lure.  I hope to make a more in depth video on this subject. As well as how to ween off of treats as well.  But for now here is my Dog training tip of the day. I created the video immediately after having the idea to make it, so I used my own dogs, it would have been great to have used a puppy.  I encourage other dog trainers out there to make How to videos on how to fade a lure when training with food, because it is information that is very important to stop training enthusiasts from getting stuck down the road 


Quick tips when using a lure:

1 Get RID of the lure as soon as you can! The goal is within 3 trials. 

2  If you don't have a clicker use a very short word like ""yes!"" or ""yep!""  

3 Always make it harder and harder, don't get stuck at the same level of criteria

4 If you go to far to quickly you can always go back a step

5 If your dog is not following the lure, get a smellier lure- real meat!

JY7JrteQBOQ,Dog Training by Kikopup,Stop barking on a walk - Barking- Episode 3,"This is the third episode in the series of Barking.  In this episode I will show you the beginning exercises on how to teach your dog not to bark on a walk.  Stay tuned and Subscribe to see  other exercises that are very useful for reactive dogs and dogs that are hyperactive.

All these exercises benefit ANY dog, not just fearful, reactive or aroused dogs.  These same exercises are GREAT for dogs with little impulse control, the kind of dog that wants to pull towards everything on a walk. 
-----------------------
When a dog becomes aroused or reactive, it is due to chemicals being released by the brain, effecting the dogs behavior.  Not only does a dogs behavior change because of these chemicals and stress hormones, but their heart beat, respiration, and blood flow will change too.  Jerking a dogs neck will not reduce these chemicals, instead it will INCREASE them.


Barking can be reinforcing, so the more a dog is allowed to bark the more likely they will continue barking in the future.  When you and your dog are surprised on a walk and your dog starts to bark, simply say ""Let's Go"" and move briskly in the opposite direction.  You can use this cue whenever you change direction unexpectedly or need to move from an area that is causing your dog to be over their threshold.



Here are some tips:

1-when on a walk cross the street to set your dog up for success
2-If you have a very fearful or reactive dog, simply change the direction of your walk when you see something your dog wont be able to handle at this point in their training
3-Never feed the dog for looking at your treats 
4-Use real meat or cheese for these exercises, the higher value the reinforcement the faster your dog will learn.  If you use low level treats, your dog might not make any progress
5-You can use calming signals to help calm your dog on a walk.  Yawning or sighing loudly when you see the distraction.  You can also walk in an arc around the distraction rather than head on which is very unnatural for a dog to do. 
6-If you are getting frustrated, better turn and go home immediately than take it out on the dog.

One of the main reasons that people get small dogs is for the convenience of being able to take them where ever they go.  One way of taking dogs everywhere is by concealing them in a purse.  

This tutorial goes over the basic steps of purse training, and if you have a large dog, this video will also be of interest because you can use the same techniques for crate training as well as teaching cute tricks that are used in movies and commercials- like a dog going into a suitcase or a dog going into a shopping bag, you name it!

X5BjvNScFPs,Dog Training by Kikopup,How to train your dog not to bark - episode 2- barking at scary objects,"All dogs bark.  Dogs bark to communicate.  Barking tells us there is something wrong, that the dog is feeling some sort of emotion- fear, anxiety, stress, arousal, etc.  To punish a dog for this natural behavior that it has evolved to do is cruel.  However most people don't know how to solve common barking issues with their dogs, and so feel there is no choice.  I plan to make a series of episodes on barking covering all barking issues and how to train your dog not to bark in those situations.  In this video I will be showing you a simple exercise on how to change your dogs emotional state using clicker training or (saying the word 'yes').  When you change a dogs emotional state from fearful, stressed, aroused, to that of calm relaxed confident and happy, all the symptoms disappear (such as barking). 

Hope you enjoy!  

Happy training!

6jaxuTuH2ow,Dog Training by Kikopup,Gotcha!  teach your dog to be caught when loose!,"A lot of dogs will actually bite if their collar is grabbed when they are loose and fearful after having run away. 

This video was inspired by the little Shiba Inu I caught this morning at the park after it had ran away.

 The short exercises I will show you in this video explain how you can condition your dog to LOVE and feel relaxed and safe, when their collar is grabbed.

Even if your dog would never run away from you or you have a confident dog this is a great exercise to practice, incase of emergencies like a fire or flood or when your dog is hurt and could be skittish and acting abnormally.

This is actually also a great exercise to teach puppies to stop mouthing and biting when you are trying to put their leash on, or trying to handle them.  There are many handling exercises to do with your dog, this is just one of them.

24pdruHwmqs,Dog Training by Kikopup,Re: Every Dog Must Know This: How To Train Your Dog To Stay,"This video was made one and a half years ago, and I believe that my editing skills have increased greatly since then. So this is video is for the people who have been pleading me to re-release it for over a year.  Sorry for the delay.  However I plan to make a new slick version of how to teach a bombproof stay using clicker training shortly, as I am a perfectionist and this video could be confusing to a new puppy owner.  The video will have short easy to understand steps, rather that this video which is more like a rant on using positive punishment.  I must say that my beginning videos on youtube did have a hint of irritation and annoyance in them, as it seemed at the time- a couple years back, there were not really any videos on how to teach things with TRUE clicker training, just a mix and match medley of using a clicker and then punishing the dog... I have realized over the years that being annoyed gets you no where, with dog or people, and so, if youll notice, my recent tutorials are less abrasive.  


The basics of this technique- Instead of saying eh eh! as you add the distraction and the dog gets up, you are going to CLICK! the dog at the very same moment the distraction happens, telling them YES! For staying there, even in the presence of THAT! then once you are confident your dog will continue staying. Start to delay your click for longer and longer AFTER the distraction has already appeared. NEVER let the dog get the distraction, if they get up, BUT you can let the dog get the distraction AFTER you release them, so you could use a person as a distraction and then the reward for staying could be to go and say hi to the person.


Thanks for watching, and heres a tip: if you are too slow to block your dog from getting to the distraction- have the dog on LEASH and throw the distractions just far enough away that the dog is unable to reach them anyway- at first.  

Another Tip:Always make the game increase in difficulty as the dog succeeds, you never want to get suck at the same level, or your dog will train you to stay at that level, they are highly intelligent

This video shows some of the tricks I have been working on recently with Kiko and Splash.  Some of the more interesting ones are, teaching Splash to look left and look right, teaching her how to skip, and how to shuffle backwards in a bow.   Kiko started offering a tap dancing behavior which I captured, as well as scratching with her back feet. I also taught Kiko to go between Splashes legs as I saw a Boston Terrier do in the movie Hotel for Dogs, and thought it would be very cute to teach.  Splash however, looks stressed as you can see, when kiko works too closely around her, because Kiko usually will boss Splash around if she is too close to her.

cQvERQoHvgg,Dog Training by Kikopup,How to paint your pets portrait,"This is a tutorial on how to paint your own pet portrait without having a background in art.  I myself  do pet portraits but went to the Slade School of Fine Art in London England, however I learned some tricks along the way for those who have no clue about drawing or art.  Hope you enjoy creating your very own painting of your pet!

 Here are the colors I used:

Titanium White
French Ultramarine Blue
Burnt Sienna (a brown)
Burnt Umber  (a dark brown)
Alizeran Crimson (a red)
Cadmium Yellow
Cadmium Orange


Other colors that are a good beginners palate:
Cadmium Red
Yellow Ochre

Mars Black (however you can mix black from the primary colors, or create a nice off black by mixing burnt sienna and ultramarine blue)  My tip is to never use real black in your painting except in tiny quantities.  


If you find that the graphite has dirtied your picture, simply wash it off with soap and water.  

If you let the painting dry between layers, or if you blow dry your painting between layers, you will be able to erase any mistakes you make on the top layer with a little warm water and a sponge.  

Tip: Change your water constantly so that it is clear.  If you mix colors with muddy water you will get a muddy painting

Tip: For fine lines and edges make sure to add a little water for a smoother easier to paint line. 

Tip: Dole out the money for the smallest brush sizes,  as buying a cheap small sized brush will just cause you heart ache and frustration.  
  
This same method can be used for painting any animal or human portrait. 

See you next time!!!!!

G31N_gmUkE0,Dog Training by Kikopup,Creating Super Puppies- Early Neurological Stimulation,"The U.S. military did studies on raising puppies, and they found that doing certain exercises with puppies during the time of rapid neurological growth, between the puppies third and sixteenth day of life would increase the pups performance in later life.  They created a program called the Bio Sensor program consisting of 5 exercises to be done once a day with the pups.   They found that not only were puppies able to cope more with stressful situations, and problem solve better than other puppies, but that they were actually physically healthier with higher cardiovascular performance, stronger immune systems, adrenal glands and heart beats.

The exercises should only be repeated once a day, as the point is to add mild stress.  More than once, and it could be overwhelming and could have the reverse effect on the puppies.

Natural handling should also be a big part of rearing puppies, and these exercises are not a replacement for that! 

These exercises should be followed up by environmental enrichment, and socialization as the puppies grow. 


Thanks to Dr. Carmen Battaglia who published an article on this subject, many breeders have started implementing early Neurological stimulation in their breeding programs.

VVH9ztmx1U8,Dog Training by Kikopup,Crazy Dog Tricks,"The first trick in this video is Splash showing Service Dog trainers that you dont have to use punishment to train service dog behaviors! Dogs are super smart, they can learn to do all we need them to do though positive reinforcement training. 

Splash turned 18 months and I got her hips x rayed recently they look awesome and the vet ok-ed doing agility and Frisbee tricks! So this is the beginning. I would like to thank Al from WhyDogsFly for helping me with learning how to throw the Frisbee. I am still a major novice and struggling with throwing.  Arg!  I hate being the typical girl who cant  throw!  Thats ok, because Splash will make me look better than I am.   However since my Frisbee lessons I think my throws have improved by at least 50%!!!  Splash thanks Al too!
 

There is an exercise in this video where I am teaching Splash to bark at me. And the reason I trained her to do this is because 1  it s great for movies and 2-  I wanted to train arousal on cue as a behavior 3-  I wanted to see if I could teach a Schutzhund bark and hold type behavior where the dog is very calm and collected but looks aroused. Meaning a safer more reliable dog, than a dog that is over aroused and over their threshold- less likely to let go when the trainer says out.","['dog', 'training', 'clicker', 'frisbee', 'obedience', 'jumps', 'disc', 'dogs', 'amazing', 'tricks', 'funny', 'service', 'behaviors', 'positive', 'reinforcement', 'reward', 'reward-based', 'progressive', 'tips', 'tip', 'tutorials', 'tutorial', 'how', 'to', 'train', 'a dog', 'the most', 'ridiculous', 'crazy', 'dog tricks', 'jumpy', 'border collie', 'crazy dog tricks', 'dog training videos', 'dog videos', 'youtube dog trainer']",2009-05-26T02:50:40Z,PT3M8S,sd,false,50198,251,0,71

If  you think in the terms that you are training your dog 100% of the time, every reinforcement you give your dog or the environment gives your dog, is building some behavior or emotional state.  What behavior and emotional state are you building every time you put your dogs food bowl down.  Are you building calmness or are you building arousal?  

You have to feed your dog every day, you might as well capture the behaviors you like and use that meal to its fullest to create a happy calm and well adjusted companion.  

Teaching your dog to settle-

9 Winners videos might be used in one of my videos, with your consent. Winners private information (address to send the prize to), will be kept private.  You can read a more detailed privacy policy here- http://www.emilyspetportraits.com/privacy.html



This trick takes some time. I would keep lessons short and fun 2-3 minutes.  You might spend a couple of lessons on each step.  I spent about 3 days getting Splash to just enjoy targeting back and forth between the chairs. 

Once your dog has got it move the trick to a new area  to practice in. Otherwise you might have a dog that can only shake their head indoors near the piano. 

If your dog looks clueless in the new location, go back a step. So if you have movable targets (like chairs) bring them to the new location, to give the dog a hint. 

If you or your dog get frustrated, just go back a step. 

I particularly liked the foot movement when Splash shakes her head.  You could also get some freestyle moves out of this trick, for instance teaching the dog to take 2 steps to the left and then 2 steps to the right etc.

You could teach Nodding Yes with the same method, but with the targets above and below the dog.

Mua6TSnEz8Q,Dog Training by Kikopup,Dog Trick Training Tutorial: Weaving Though Legs,"WIDESCREEN!!!  This is a quick video tutorial on how to teach weaving through the legs using luring or shaping. 

Einstein demos how fast a dog can pick this trick up.  The footage is almost in real time.

This exercise is great for building a shy dogs confidence.  However, take it slow, some dogs might go through your legs on the first try, others might take a week to initially feel relaxed going between your legs. I know a chihuahua in particular that was very nervous of going through her owners legs. Take it slow and dont get frustrated!

Tips:
Make sure to fade out the treat very quickly. The rule is usually- use the treat the first 3 times and then pretend to have a treat, to having an obviously empty hand

Raise criteria constantly or you will get stuck with a dog that needs a treat after each leg pass

Have fun and enjoy!

Dont forget to post a video response of your dog weaving!  Also dont be shy! Show of the awesome weave that your dog can already do!

I was also thinking of using this 'trick' as a canine freestyle move. Because she will shake her head until I tell her to stop. It looks quite cool because she does it in a rhythmic way, moving her feet at the same time. 

Hehe, I'm so cruel! Im gong to make you wait to find out how to train this!

PjegRkLdvuA,Dog Training by Kikopup,Kiko's Last Lure Course,"UPDATE: Kiko's eye is better!!!!

So after just returning from the ER, after awaking to find one of Kikos eyes completely dilated and grey.. Im in a somber mood, so thought I would make a video with a sober soundtrack.  

Poor little Keeks, I always knew there was something wrong with her legs, but all the vets seemed to think she was just double jointed and there was no issue.  Well her legs have been getting progressively worse, and so finally I went to a specialist who found out that she has no ankles (hocks). Instead of a ball and socket there are just two bones meeting. Nothing holding it together.  I am in the process of making her leg braces, however it is a very tricky task. I have tried quite a few prototypes, with much failure. Either 1- the impose on Kikos movement 2- they dont stop the leg from inverting 3- are uncomfortable for her.    So I have just been limiting her activity.
Poor thing, another option was to have the bones in her legs fused together, but that would not enable her to curl up in a little ball like she loves to do each night. :( 
Luckily she is not in pain.

You can actually see in the photographs of her running that her legs are bending the opposite way.  They look like they are made of rubber. 

The pictures were taken at the lure course by someone called Gary Gionet back in 2007 during one of her runs. I got the pictures off the luratics website, and so hope that it is alright to use them in this video to remember how Kiko used to love the course a lure!","['course', 'lure', 'chihuahua', 'cute', 'run', 'adorable', 'kiko', 'coursing', 'dog', 'training', 'ankle', 'hock', 'vet', 'brian', 'eno', 'stuck', 'by', 'this', 'river', 'clicker', 'positive', 'reinforcement', 'reward', 'reward-based', 'progressive', 'tips', 'tip', 'tutorials', 'tutorial', 'how', 'to', 'train', 'a dog']",2008-10-18T21:01:11Z,PT1M56S,sd,false,4384,36,0,27

t5WEl3ob1O0,Dog Training by Kikopup,Dog Trick Tutorial: Teaching Limp,"How to teach your dog to Limp

This is a video on how to teach your dog to Limp using the clicker training method.

 The old school way of training this behavior was to grab your dogs paw, restraining it while you walk forwards, and continue to do this until your dog doesn't put down their foot.  Another way I saw in a book was to have your dog on a lead with their choke chain on, and loop it around their foot, so in order for the pain to be released on their neck, they had to raise their paw. 

So INSTEAD, using the clicker training method, I will show you how to get your dog to figure it out all on their own!  Not only is training like this fun for you and your dog, it is both mentally  challenging for you and your dog.  I can bet you that if you attempt this trick your dog will be taking a LOOONNNGGG nap afterwards!  Mental stimulation is just as good at tiring out a dog as physical stimulation. :)

Keep sessions very short (3 min) and fun, it should take quite a few sessions on each of the steps to get the final behavior down, unless you have a three legged dog... 

Happy Clicker Training!

See you next time!

There are many ways to teach this behavior.  Another being, holding out your hand and asking the dog to ""Shake"" and then whipping your hand away so that the dogs foot lands on top of the other foot.  There is also another way, where the trainer can lure the dog to the left or right when they are in the down position and the dog will naturally cross their paws to reach the treat, which you can use your clicker to capture.  

Let me know if you do succeed in getting your dog to cross their paws!  Some dogs are easier than others!  Kiko with her match stick legs (who NEVER crosses her paws hardly ever) was a challenge! 

Also pay attention to the way your dogs hips are laying.  If they lay with their hips to one side, then it might be easier for them to cross their paws in one direction better than the other.  If they are lying like a lion then they will be able to cross both ways with the same ease.","['clicker', 'training', 'dog', 'video', 'how', 'to', 'tips', 'tip', 'obedience', 'canine', 'amazing', 'animal', 'cute', 'chihuahua', 'tricks', 'freestyle', 'positive', 'reinforcement', 'reward', 'reward-based', 'progressive', 'tutorials', 'tutorial', 'train', 'a dog']",2008-09-29T03:39:39Z,PT2M7S,sd,false,112025,559,0,95

sFgtqgiAKoQ,Dog Training by Kikopup,Train your dog to STOP pulling on leash,"This video quickly outlines exercises to get your dog walking on a loose leash by your side.   Put very basically FIRST you will teach the dog what you want them to do!  And secondly, stop reinforcing them when they pull!   

I demonstrate the exercise using a clicker, but if you do not have one, you can always use a verbal marker like yes etc.   However you will get much faster and reliable results by using the clicker.  If you hold the clicker in the same hand as the leash, and keep the treats in the other hand, you will find it easier to manage.  Practice holding the leash, clicker, and treats when you  do not have the dog attached to the leash yet, so you dont become overwhelmed.   

A great book on loose leash walking, or how to stop your dog from pulling is-

My Dog Pulls. What Do I Do? by Turid Rugaas 

You can get this book on www.dogwise.com  and other places too.  Its very short and has lots of pictures.  

I would advise against using any forms of positive punishment when teaching any behavior, but especially leash walking, as startling or hurting a dog actually increases their stress hormones in their body causing the dog to be more hyperactive and more likely to become aroused and reactive towards other dogs and people (weather they want to greet them or not).

DO NOT DROP THE LEASH! I showed myself dropping the leash on a street with no cars/danger and another person there.  This would happen during an emergency, if you trip or fumble.  In no way do I support people who walk with their dogs off leash,  you never can tell if a car will backfire, or who knows what, an  earthquake etc with frighten your dog, and cause it to run into traffic. If you don't like holding a leash, simply tie it to your waist like I do with my dogs.  However walking in a safe place where dogs are allowed off leash is perfectly acceptable :)

uOjvaLWDzuI,Dog Training by Kikopup,Dog Trick Training Tutorial: How to train your dog to jump over your arms,"Here is a quick video I made of how to teach this very cool Canine Freestyle trick- hurdles. I dont actually know what the trick is called by freestylers, so I made up the name 'hurdles' . 

I didnt use a clicker during this exercise as is quite hard to hold the clicker and it clicks right under the dog which can make them confused.  If possible you can get a friend to help mark the behavior.  

Good luck! And let me know if you have any questions!

p.s. I did some sloppy training in this video! I give multiple  cues such as 'jump' 'hup' and 'jump through' ! and am sloppy with the reward.  Which makes me have to say, if you are really into training, make sure to film yourself to assess what you think you are doing to what you are actually doing! :)

Note:  For Splash the word 'yes' is a conditioned reinforcer like some people use 'good girl' so you will see me say 'yes' and not give a treat afterwards.  For Splash and Kiko the click means a treat always follows.  Any other word means they might get one, they might not.

iaWu0NJSaV0,OneMindDogs,Dog agility in sumo suits!! OneMind Dogs Coaches take up the challenge,"Watch as our leading coaches run an agility course in sumo suits!

OneMind Dogs Coaches have been seen handling their dogs wearing garbage bags, handling without running or handling without using their voice. This time the Coaches accepted a really weird challenge. 

Wearing a huge sumo outfit is very heavy (44 pounds / 20 kg) and slows the handler down a lot. The outfit also limits the way you can use your body: you turn around a lot slower, the movement of your feet is limited and it‚Äôs very hard to move your arms. 

That is why you need to focus on the most important elements in your handling:
Movement - the timing and direction of your movement is very important to your dog. Even more so when the other elements are limited.
Position - How you position yourself will determine how easily your dog can follow your handling.

Ensisijaisesti pentu tuo tietenkin mukanaan paljon iloa ja hyv√§√§ mielt√§, mutta monet uuden pennun omistajat kohtaavat my√∂s toisenlaisia tilanteita.

Tunnistatko kenties itsess√§si jotain seuraavista tunteista:
- Ahdistuneisuus, riitt√§m√§tt√∂myyden tunne
- Stressi
- Toivottomuus
- Pelko
- Ehk√§ jopa niin sanottu ‚ÄúPuppy Blues‚Äù -tunne, jossa kaduttaa pennun hankinta?

Jos yll√§olevat tunteet tuntuvat edes jossain m√§√§rin tutuilta, on OneMind Dogsin webinaari pennun koulutuksesta juuri sinua varten!

Webinaarissa k√§yd√§√§n l√§pi viisi t√§rke√§√§ teemaa, jotka auttavat sinua onnistumaan pentusi kanssa. Lis√§ksi toivomme, ett√§ webinaari tuo lis√§√§ uskoa ja mielenrauhaa, jotta pennun kouluttaminen ei stressaisi liikaa. 

Saat vinkkej√§ mm. seuraaviin tilanteisiin:
- Miten voit saada lis√§√§ uskoa omiin taitoihisi
- Miten saat pennun oppimaan ja tekem√§√§n, mit√§ toivot
- Miten saavutat onnellisen ja tasapainoisen suhteen pennun kanssa

""Succeeding in dog agility: How to train effectively by yourself""

We are so excited to have you join our webinar ""Succeeding in dog agility: How to train effectively by yourself.""  Training agility on your own can be a challenge! Some people find it hard to get motivated or know what to train. It can also feel more difficult to critique yourself and come up with suggestions for improvement. However, sometimes we don‚Äôt have a choice but to train by ourselves; and it‚Äôs actually one of the best ways to learn more about YOUR team!

OneMind Dogs Coach Niki Drage first learned the OneMind Dogs method all by herself, studying online and training in her yard. Niki will share her main tips for training by yourself, building motivation and routines, and how to listen to your best ever coach - your dog! While Niki loves sharing training sessions with friends, she makes the most significant discoveries and improvements when training alone and focusing on herself and her dog.

In the webinar we'll cover these topics: 
- How to train agility in your home or backyard?
- How to build routines and stay motivated?
- How to critique yourself and adapt your training plan?
- How to use online programs and coaching effectively?
- How to get feedback remotely?
- What do we mean by saying the dog is the best coach?
- How to keep the training exciting and fun for your dog?

The best part is that there's no need for agility equipment! You can use ANY object you have around at home, in the park, on the street ‚Äî whatever! 

Dogs love to figure out how to earn rewards by themselves, their motivation to do things increases and they are more likely to offer behaviors in the future. That is why offering a behavior is one of the most important exercises in OneMind Dogs foundation training.

Once your puppy gets used to offering behaviors and figuring things out himself, it will be super easy to teach him all the obstacles. You will end up with a dog who is brave and confident to try new things.

asIEVa2di3c,OneMindDogs,Candy Cane Challenge,"Give your dog the gift of great communication this Christmas! As a special themed challenge we would like you to run these courses without using your hands and arms. 

As some possible suggestions we recommend using gift wrapping paper, ribbon or even a large gift box around your arms to stop yourself from using them to guide your dog. Instead, use your other 6 handling elements (motion, position, eyes, chest, feet, voice) to handle these courses.

OneMind Dogs Coach Niki Drage ran all 3 courses with her dogs and without using her hands! She took a video of her training for your inspiration! Her biggest tip is to focus on connecting with your dog, you will be amazed how much you can communicate with just your eyes!","['agility', 'onemind dogs', 'dog agility', 'christmas', 'challenge']",2018-12-21T14:49:40Z,PT3M41S,hd,false,1045,25,0,0

_Z0pw5Zsmxg,OneMindDogs,The Three C's of Dog Agility: Connect - Commit - Cue,"Imagine a universal language. A language between human and dog. A language that every dog on the planet naturally understands.

And now imagine the language is almost silent.

The master trainers here at OneMind Dogs describe this language as the Three C's. The first C is for Connect ‚Äì maintaining your connection with your dog is your number one job. This can be achieved with straight eye contact, or by letting the dog see the side profile of your face. You can see where dog's attention is focused by looking at his eyes and so predict what he is going to do next.

The second C is for Commit. Once the connection is created, your dog can commit and move towards the next obstacle. The earlier the commitment to the next obstacle is made, the faster your dog can advance on the course.

Now you can move on to telling your dog what is going to happen next. We want to teach our dogs to stay committed no matter what we do after the commitment. 

The third C is for Cue. When your dog has the information on where to continue after the obstacle, he can make the adjustments needed for the next situation. 

We use the OneMind Dogs Handling Techniques to give our dogs as much information as we can as early as possible. 

Learning the universal language with OneMind Dogs is easy and fun. Join our pack at www.oneminddogs.com!

HlfAr3GI9uw,OneMindDogs,Japanese Agility Handling Technique,"Japanese is a technique where you are ahead of your dog while asking him to perform what appears to be the backside of an obstacle from your dog's point of view.

This technique is ideal for handlers who find it difficult to execute turning maneuvers due to physical limitations such as knee injuries or other disabilities. It is also a great technique for dogs who slow down when you turn to face them as you would in Forced Front Cross.

U1vNk2jsBes,OneMindDogs,OneMind Dogs Coach Jessica Ajoux  - Westminster Winning Agility Run Analysis,"OneMind Dogs Coach Jessica Ajoux and Border Collie Fame(US) had an amazingly successful winning run at Westminster 2018. Watch Jessica analyse her winning performance in detail.

In this video Jessica breaks down the lines in the course and how they impacted which handling techniques she chose. You‚Äôll also hear her technical analysis of her handling throughout the whole course. Jessica clearly demonstrates how your choices on one part of the course can really affect your handling options further down the track.

2018 Westminster Kennel Club dog show is an event that took place at Pier 94 in New York in mid February. 330 dogs were entered in the agility competition where Jessica and Fame(US) won the Masters Agility Championship.

Jessica and Fame(US) are a great example of a team that works seamlessly together. Jessica's handling is very brave and determined: in this run you can see as a handler she really goes for her plan and commits to the handling techniques she has chosen, but at the same time she is so clear in her handling that her dog never has to question anything. She makes the course extremely easy to read for the dog with exemplary execution of CCC - Connect, Commit, Cue between every obstacle.

Poetry in motion, a true example of two souls, one mind. It‚Äôs so obvious that the relationship between Jessica and Fame(US) runs much deeper than just a team in agility, they clearly have a very special bond. Thank you Jessica for sharing your insight on this run!

LGFDb26KDeI,OneMindDogs,Reaching the Running Points OneMind Dogs Agility Training,"OneMind Dogs handlers think of a agility course as a series of lines and running points, rather than obstacles. Each course has critical points that a handler should reach when their dog is in a specific position on the course, so that they are able to cue a change in the dog‚Äôs line effectively. Every dog and handler team has different strengths and weaknesses so finding your own ‚Äúsignature‚Äù within the OneMind Dogs method really allows you to play to your strengths.

Oo2RPkVqlfw,OneMindDogs,OneMind Dogs agility handling technique - Tandem Turn,"Tandem Turn is one of the techniques that will turn your dog away from you. It is a very useful technique for handlers who are not always able to be close to the obstacles to cue a turn. When performing a Tandem Turn, both you and your dog turn 180 degrees together, facing in the same direction. The handler turns the dog on the flat, between the obstacles. 

Tandem Turn requires some basic teaching without obstacles, as turning away from the handler is not natural for many dogs.
This short course will give you an overview of a Tandem Turn from the very basics to the point where you get to teach it to your dog: https://www.oneminddogs.com/article/tandem-turn-agility-handling-technique/",,2016-01-18T11:20:38Z,PT1M5S,hd,false,21249,129,0,0

Remember that you‚Äôre going to face exactly the same obstacles as before - there‚Äôs nothing you already haven‚Äôt done tens or hundreds times before successfully already. Just do what you normally do - that‚Äôs how you earned your spot at the championships! And do what you would do at the practice.

üö® READ AVSAB'S UPDATED ""POSITION STATEMENT ON HUMANE DOG TRAINING"" HERE: https://avsab.ftlbcdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AVSAB-Humane-Dog-Training-Position-Statement-2021.pdf

Links to the studies etc we discussed in this video (we did run out of space üòÇ): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IdIl4bqGkhkVQy2G6molJO1y0nG7Ew5icAvF8obpXX4/edit?usp=sharing

TIMESTAMPS! By popular demand! üôå 

0:00 Hi! AVSAB has updated their position statement!
1:07 Thank you Nom Nom!
1:50 Let's talk! Tag your favorite dog trainers in the comments!
3:17 What even is AVSAB? 
5:42 What does ""AVERSIVE"" mean? What are ""AVERSIVE TOOLS""?
6:53 What is new about this position statement on dog training methods (compared to their previous position)??
8:07 Disclosing our bias
8:44 CONCLUSION of AVSAB's new position statement (read aloud)
9:39 What does this mean for dog trainers?
12:34 HIGHLIGHTS from AVSAB position statement (read aloud with commentary)
17:00 STUDIES cited by AVSAB - What are their flaws?? Do they really support this conclusion??
21:12 Where are the studies supporting the opposite viewpoint (that aversive or ""balanced"" methods are more efficient and better for dogs' overall welfare than reinforcement-based methods that exclude aversive corrections)?
22:11 STUDY DISCUSSION: ""The Welfare Consequences and Efficacy of Training Pet Dogs with Remote Electronic Training Collars in Comparison to Reward Training"" 
25:00 Does this mean aversive corrections are ABUSE???
25:46 STUDY DISCUSSION: ""Comparison of Stress and Learning Effects of 3 Different Training Methods: Electronic Training Collar, Pinch Collar and Quitting Signal""
27:30 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS/OBJECTIONS - What do you think???
32:19 What about our personal experience? Let's talk about ANECDOTES!! 
33:58 What should we do now???

Some of you were confused as to why I decided to show you how to teach your dog to enjoy a muzzle. After all, positive trainers shouldn‚Äôt need such a restrictive ‚Äútool‚Äù, right? The fact is that there are a variety of scenarios where a muzzle can be used to keep people and other animals safer without causing significant stress to the dog wearing a muzzle. I should also mention that every credible positive trainer that I am aware of endorses muzzle use when necessary and properly introduced.

There is a negative stigma associated with muzzle training, and for good reason in some cases. There is absolutely a way to misuse a muzzle. For example it would not be a good idea to let dog with a bite history and no training approach, say, another dog, simply because the dog with the bite history was wearing a muzzle. This could easily cause the dog to reach a level of ‚Äúamygdala hijack‚Äù, where the dog loses control and becomes and becomes difficult to manage. A muzzle would only add to that distressing situation making future training unnecessarily harder.

In the case of working with a dog with a bite history, having a muzzle on that dog may be advisable in certain situations. Then, as I‚Äôm sure some of you can relate with, there are dogs that are generally good unless they are surprised by another dog, say, on a walk in a public setting (where it is harder to control the environment), and having your dog comfortable wearing a muzzle is a good idea simply as a failsafe. The main priority is maintaining a proper working distance when one is working with a dog that might be likely to bite another dog or person of course. But things don't always go as planned, particularly in more public settings.

Furthermore, any one of our dogs could be injured and require medical attention and need to be muzzled, as most dogs are not themselves when in pain. Therefore it‚Äôs advisable to make sure that your dog has at least been through the process of learning to wear a muzzle before this happens. The type of muzzle also matters. I always use a particular basket muzzle that allows the dog to pant and drink water at will as well as receive treats during training if necessary.

At the end of the day, it is our responsibility to keep our dogs safe and to make sure that we do everything we can to keep training an enjoyable, productive process. I hope this clears things up for those of you who were a bit confused!

Thanks for reading.
Zak George

This is a text book dog training lesson with Roux the border collie puppy! Roux listens pretty well, but at 5 months old, she‚Äôs still inconsistent when it comes to listening in distracting situations.

 If you want your dog to listen to you in situations they find distracting you have to prepare them for these occasions. I‚Äôll show you two easy training exercises you can do to start building solid communication between you and your dog.

In this new episode of the Dog Training rEvolution Logan and his girlfriend Beverly asked for some help with their dog, Mona Lisa. She has dangerous habit of running out of the front door when it‚Äôs open. Mona Lisa and I were put to the test when cats, dogs and pedestrians attempted to derail our training session. This is honestly a life saving skill that EVERY dog needs to know. Please take the time to watch this video to make sure that you know how to teach your dog to stay when the door is open. There is nothing more important than keeping your dog out of harm‚Äôs way.

Please Like and Share. Sincerely, I cannot express how important it is for dogs to know fetch if they have a lot of energy. If you are struggling with fetch or don‚Äôt know where to get started or just want a refresher, watch this episode.

I‚Äôll cover the most common problems I hear about with teaching fetch including what to do if your dog chases it but won‚Äôt bring it back, won‚Äôt let go, gets bored quickly, or plays inside, but not outside and more!

Lafitte has been doing some property damage to the walls, so Michael and Dianna asked for some help. Did you know that a well played game of fetch on a regular basis will dramatically reduce or stop virtually all excessive unwanted behaviors like chewing, scratching, digging, jumping, leash pulling and more?
Plus active dogs generally live a longer, happier life if they routinely and vigorously exercise. 

My experience tells me that a lot of people stop too soon when it comes to teaching fetch. In fact, most people are about 3 training sessions away from having a dog that understands the basic rules of fetch, with the proper guidance of course ;).","['How to train your dog fetch', 'Dog Training', 'Puppy training', 'Zak George', 'how to stop chewing dog', 'how to stop jumping dog', 'how to stop dog pulling on leash', 'sit', 'stay', 'come', 'down', 'how to train my dog to listen']",2014-11-13T01:49:44Z,PT13M10S,hd,false,1619435,29588,0,1248

***UPDATE***
I wanted to take a moment to respond to a minority of comments on this video. While the video currently enjoys a 96+% like to dislike ratio, I have noticed a handful of comments criticizing this video for not featuring dogs that are not dog friendly. For example one viewer writes: 

""No real info here... you are showing ideal scenarios while you should be addressing real scenarios, aggressiveness is the issue when dogs meet... ""

Among beginners and intermediate trainers there is often this idea that we need to wait for problems to emerge before addressing them. Particularly in the area of puppy socialization, the best medicine is prevention. If you hope to excel in understanding and modifying dog behavior there is one point you need to understand. Preparation and prevention are essential to showing a dog how to behave in our culture. If more people knew to take the advice I offered in this video, then we would have fewer issues in this department. So to this viewer and others who‚Äôve echoed this sentiment, I would say that ABSOLUTELY I am showing ideal scenarios! Showing your dog from day one how to behave around dogs will prevent future issues from arising much of the time.

As you know, I routinely address reactivity, nervous dogs and fearful dogs in my videos all the time. A lot of us adopt an older dog or under socialize our dogs while they are young and are left with the dilemma of what to do when our dogs are older and are not very accepting of people and dogs. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll address this more in the future on a case by case basis. But that‚Äôs just it, once your dog has crossed into a pattern of behavior that is potentially dangerous to you, other people, or other animals, then we need to address that on an individual basis (as you‚Äôve seen me do in several videos) and there is no broad brush stroke that will fix that. 

The best dog trainers do everything they can to show their dogs how to behave rather than how NOT to behave. That‚Äôs not to say we can‚Äôt ‚Äúfix‚Äù dogs who have social issues, it‚Äôs that this is a completely different topic. The person who just got a dog MUST know the info. in this video.

I certainly do not want to discourage those critical of my lessons. This is one way that everyone can learn and grow. And the biggest lessons I've learned in my career have come directly from you. I just felt that these critiques were coming from a place that lacks experience and understanding of dog behavior which is why I wanted to clarify my point a bit more. 

The aim of this video was to give people a general idea as to how to make sure that their dog remains comfortable with new dogs moving forward, and socialization can be a complex issue. Obviously I cannot address every aspect of canine social behavior in a single lesson. This video is for the average person with an average dog. But I do pride myself on showcasing a variety of scenarios and I‚Äôll continue to do that in the future.

Thank you!

How many of your dogs bark at guests when they come over? This is often a sign of anxiety, fearfulness or reluctance of interacting with new people. This was the case with Milli the rescue dog. Dogs like this are misunderstood too often. In this video I'll show you how I approach working with a dog who barks out of uncertainty. In order to be successful at helping your dog overcome this issue, you'll need to understand their body language.  I'll show you how some common things to look for to assess a nervous, fearful, or vocal dog's state of mind.

Teach your dog the exercise referenced at 2:45 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mWwU3aWPIU

This is THE VIDEO that you have been waiting for and it's, by far, the most dramatic leash walking video I've ever made. You won't believe the thing that set's this dog off! In this video you'll see Lafitte, the all American mutt, and his wonderful mom and trainer, Rachel,  presented with real life distractions on an ACTUAL walk in a city neighborhood including squirrels, moving vehicles, a barking dog, and something that you'll have to SEE to BELIEVE! 
And of course I'll show you how we get him under control WITHOUT the use of a choke chain, prong collar or electronic collar.

This week's video is a special one! My latest addition to the subject of humane, pleasant, leash walking will show you what to do when your dog stops paying attention due to distraction on a walk. Eva and her labradoodle puppy Boudreaux are youtube subscribers of mine who live in San Diego and wanted to get together for a video while she was visiting New Orleans! Boudreaux is doing exceptional for her age and it's clear that Eva spends a lot of time with her, BUT when he's distracted he doesn't listen as well as she'd like.

Does your dog respond to you when distracted?

I recently stopped by a local shelter here in New Orleans, Animal Rescue New Orleans, to work with some dogs who are in need of a great home! Dogs like this are so appreciative of attention from people and that makes most them super easy to begin training immediately! I wanted to make this video to show you that the majority of shelter dogs are very receptive to learning.

How to train your dog not to bark

Literally THOUSANDS of you have requested this video! Unwanted barking is the reason so many people give up on a dog. Share this video so that more people know how to handle this easy to correct issue. 

In my research before making this video, I discovered so many videos offering some pretty questionable advice and some downright bad advice. When I found decent videos almost all of them included one type of unwanted barking and one dog. 

This video includes lots of different examples and varied advice for different situations, including what to do when your dog will not respond to you even if you have treats.

Does your dog bark people, dogs, other animals? Does your dog bark when you are walking? Does your dog bark when you leave? There is no need to use punishment to teach your dog to not bark. Adopt an attitude of patience and you'll fix this in no time at all!

What do you want my next video to be about?
A) Unwanted Jumping
B) Staying at the front door so that your dog doesn't run into the street","['Train dog to stop barking', 'how to train a dog to stop barking', 'how to make a dog stop barking', 'bark', 'barks', 'can you train a dog to stop barking', 'professional dog training', 'Zak George (TV Actor)', 'dog trainer', 'dog training', 'positive dog training', 'positive reinforcment', 'how to stop barking']",2013-09-03T20:07:51Z,PT7M,hd,false,3378320,38333,0,3146

Beaux is BACK! 

As a dog trainer, people always ask what the best way to eliminate destructive or other unwanted behaviors. While most people realize that controlling our dog's environment is key, very few people realize that THIS ONE LITTLE THING is the best thing you can do to discourage your dog from being destructive and your dog will be happier too!

What do pulling on a leash, jumping on people,  barking for ""no reason"", and destroying property all have in common? The SAME solution!

This morning on Facebook I asked how many of you would be interested in a video that showed you how make your dog less treat dependent on behaviors they already know. In just a few hours OVER 600 of you (that is a lot of people!) said you wanted me to make that video. I was happy to do it! I'll give you my formula to working towards actually teaching your dog to listen to you without rewards! 

Also I'm still willing to drive anywhere in the USA to help someone teach their dog if my Facebook page reaches 25,000 likes by Sept. 13! Help me get there by sharing my posts and videos:)

Rewarding our dogs with food is the default way that we are told to reinforce desirable behavior with our dogs. BUT MANY DOGS like to be rewarded with toys too! Some dogs actually prefer ""play rewards"". 

This video is a MUST for anyone who has a dog with energy or ""A.D.D"". One of the biggest misconceptions in dog training today is that a dog with a lot of energy is hard to train. NOT TRUE my friends! You just need to reward them with what they WANT:)

The basics in dog training need to be super solid before we can hope to master advanced training later. Every dog learns at a different rate, and different dogs react differently to training. It's vital that we tailor our approach accordingly when teaching our dogs. 
Lots of dogs like to pull on a leash. Dogs naturally walk faster than we do, but how do we teach them to to walk without pulling? ""Come when called"" is a potentially life saving skill for our dogs. But what do we do when they accidentally get out? How do you work with with a nervous dog in an environment where they feel overwhelmed?

Is your dog nervous or unsure? Does your dog become stressed when in new places? How do you work with a dog that barks and growls at you?  

Too often, we judge a dog who growls as being dangerous or dominant. If a pit bull or American bull dog looks a certain way and growls, they may have a hard time gaining acceptance in society because of the misguided information about these dogs. Building MUTUAL trust with our dogs is key in giving them the best life that we can. Beaux was a recent dog in my class. He has an unbreakable bond with him mom and trainer, but when it comes to strangers, he's not so accepting.

Beaux is a dog that I think many of you might relate with as far as your own dogs are concerned.

In all of my classes and with all of my students, my goal is illustrate how easy teaching a dog really is. 

Dogs are individuals that react differently to things depending upon their personality. Sincerity is one the required components to having a super obedient dog.  I find that I can only guide people to that point as you cannot easily teach this trait! To my surprise though, many people quickly ""get it"" and, therefore, they also get rapid progress during training. On the other side, dogs do not respond (well) to a frustrated trainer.

Does your dog know how to sit? Almost all of you will answer ""Yes"" to that. BUT, will your dog generally sit the first time every time? I'll give you some guidance in this video. One of the least known things among beginners when it comes to training is the importance of training in various environments. Dogs are brilliant animals, but they do not generalize well. I'll try and give you some advice on that and more in this video!

Eye contact is an essential brick in the foundation of authentic dog training. Dogs are one of the few species that naturally look at humans in the eyes to communicate with them.  Since dogs do this naturally, it's a pretty easy step to teach them to look at us when we ask them to! This video shows you EXACTLY how to do just that! 

Let me know if you like it:)

Introduction to Clicker Training:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3Ix6G6T56Q

When teaching your dog anything, the goal should be to encourage them to perform the desired action on their own accord. In general we should avoid making them do things and instead make them WANT to do what it is we ask. ""Speak"" is a great example. No matter how much you want a dog to bark at your request, you cannot force them to. Therefore, we must find a way to motivate them to do this. In this video, I'll show you a way to accomplish this!","['Dogs', 'Puppy', 'How to teach dog to speak', 'trick', 'how to train your dog to bark', 'puppy training', 'how to train a dog', 'Zak George (TV Actor)']",2012-11-25T11:34:07Z,PT4M8S,hd,false,2251327,23677,0,1366
