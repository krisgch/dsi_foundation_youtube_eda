- Thailand is a country with less dog training knowledge in comparison to Europe or even our neighbor Singapore

- One of the main reason is the lack in available educational resources which has stalled developments of both the training skills of trainers and the knowledge of the people

- Which allows many ‘poor’, ‘abusive’ and ‘unethical’ dog trainers/breeders to easily take advantage of their customers – from selling ineffective (even counter-productive) courses to breeding and selling of unhealthy dogs


Identify key action points to build and expand my own educational dog training YouTube channel by analyzing insights from dog training channels

In order to grow my subscribers and views, I asked the following questions and form my hypothesis:

- Which content relates to the viewers?  		

- Effects of good title writing? 			

- What’s the best video duration?			

- How many times posts per month?		

- Is it better to post on weekdays or weekends?
