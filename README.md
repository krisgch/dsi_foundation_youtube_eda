### Project Overview
This project is part of TDA's DSI Python Foundation Capstone Project, as a key requirement to complete the course. Combining my passion of data analysis and dog training, I've chosen to analyse 'dog training' YouTube channels in order to identify key insights and good practices done by other channels. The ultimate goal of this project is to grow my own 'dog training' YouTube channel to become an educational platform that are more accessible to Thai people, which will eventually lower the number of unethical breeders/trainers in Thailand.

### Problem Statement
- Thailand is a country with less dog training knowledge in comparison to Europe or even our neighbor Singapore
- One of the main reason is the lack in available educational resources which has stalled developments of both the training skills of trainers and the knowledge of the people
- Which allows many ‘poor’, ‘abusive’ and ‘unethical’ dog trainers/breeders to easily take advantage of their customers – from selling ineffective (even counter-productive) courses to breeding and selling of unhealthy dogs

### Goal and Target
- Identify key action points to build and expand my own educational dog training YouTube channel by analyzing insights from dog training channels
- Target : +100 subscribers & +100 views per videos

### Social Impact
- "More eduacted dog owners" = "Less unethical/abusive dog trainer/breeders"

### Hypotheses
In order to grow my subscribers and views, I asked the following questions and form my hypothesis:
- Which content relates to the viewers?  		
- Effects of good title writing? 			
- What’s the best video duration?			
- How many times posts per month?		
- Is it better to post on weekdays or weekends?

### Technologies
