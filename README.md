- Thailand is a country with less dog training knowledge in comparison to Europe or even our neighbor Singapore

- One of the main reason is the lack in available educational resources which has stalled developments of both the training skills of trainers and the knowledge of the people

- Which allows many ‘poor’, ‘abusive’ and ‘unethical’ dog trainers/breeders to easily take advantage of their customers – from selling ineffective (even counter-productive) courses to breeding and selling of unhealthy dogs


# Identify key action points to build and expand my own educational dog training YouTube channel by analyzing insights from dog training channels

# In order to grow my subscribers and views, I asked the following questions and form my hypothesis:

- Which content relates to the viewers?  		

- Effects of good title writing? 			

- What’s the best video duration?			

- How many times posts per month?		

- Is it better to post on weekdays or weekends?
