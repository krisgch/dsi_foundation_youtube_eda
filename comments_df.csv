A35DFDv5mfY,"[""Question: Where you say that WE have to remain calm and not be freaked out - I am curious what a good strategy might be to this. I mean - Halloween aside - there ARE times when 'things' happen and we, as people, DO get spooked/startled while on the other end of that leash and sort of pass that 'spook' down to the dog without meaning to. Example, when a person or dog pops out of the bushes just in front of you. This can be very startling to me, as a human and can cause a legit 'freak out' reaction momentarily. What is the best way to 'diffuse' these frights so your dog can realize it's fine and you're good, despite the fright?\n\nMy usual response - once the initial freak-out occurs is to start laughing, apologize to the dog and let her know it's fine. I'm fine. We're fine. Let's move on and have some fun!

Still waiting for the mountain melt to finish rushing down and waiting for the river to settle.) and rather than walking, we'll just play in the water for an hour or so. So by the time we're done, she's tired, and reasonably cool.

She's not 'dog aggressive' and doesn't mind meeting and hanging out with other dogs. . .but she HATES it when they rush her and get right up in her face and space. (and yeah, she can get a little snappy in that scenario. Something we've been working on and she's miles better. But its so much easier when the other dogs just give her her space.) Thankfully MOST dogs we meet will rush up, then stop ten or so feet away, look at her, and realize - she doesn't want them in her face and they'll either come in more quietly - or just turn off and go sniff something else. But. . .this is not always the case and protecting her, letting her have that space until she's ready to meet them is challenging. This gives me some extra ideas to work with. \n\nAnd yeah, I usually have to tell people no, your dog can't play with mine. She doesn't know HOW to play with other dogs. She's easily overwhelmed and doesn't realize 'wrestling' or even chasing is supposed to be fun. Even though she's a larger dog, she still feels like they're trying to hurt her, and will sort of freak out. She likes company - but she likes it when other dogs are just 'there' with her, as opposed to trying to maul her. So I usually have to tell people no as well.

mCTadOJnGzo,"['Hi Guys! I have really enjoyed listening to your YouTube and watching. I have a very tricky problem with my two dogs. I have an idea of what might work, but think it may also cause an issue. I am in Australia and was wondering if you could assist with some advice for a home set up for a two dog house hold. They are very chilled, but one does not like the other dog who has vision/hearing loss startling him and accidentally walking on him when he is asleep. It’s a tricky one, she normally reads the signals as they have lived together peacefully for 7 years. I was thinking about settling up  a safe space but don’t sure if that will make his resource guarding worse. I know the triggers, but I worry as although they are both old, my diabetic dog is more fragile. She had cataract surgery 4 years and corneal grafts this year for CED and twice in the last month my 12 year old dog has hurt her, I’m worried about going back to work and her getting hurt and she has only front teeth so ended up not being able to defend herself. I have baby gates and all the gear, just would be interested in your thoughts on a set up for this? Like keeping his safe space always in the same spot so see knows. Also I am looking for a toy that is interactive for poor vision/hearing and not food related due to diabeties but scent related. I can not find anything, I use puzzles, nose toys and light up but can’t find anything that is diabetic dog friendly and easy to see and hear. She still plays but would like to find something she can still get more enjoyment and mental stimulation with? Thanks :) Also, my 14 year greyhound recently passed, which has slightly changed the dynamics, my 12 male dachshund likes his own company and would in the past spend most of this time asleep next to my 14 yearsfemale greyhound that passed. He loves other dogs and does not need or want my attention where my 14 year old dog diabetic female dachshund  I have a had since she was a puppy and prefers to be around me which is ok, she used to be boss to the other two but she has slowed down and calmed as she has aged and now very good. My male dog never would have attacked my greyhound and my greyhound never would fight back if my female dachshund was nasty, so I wonder if my male dog is still wary of my female dachshunds past behaviour before she became nicer. If that makes sense? My male dachshund has really good dog skills and you can put him with most of not all dogs, he has manners and grew up before I had him in a multi dog household of 10.']"

Since you say you read every comment, I am hoping for a reply, as my inquiry is one I have not seen a video for. You despise the use of choke chains and E-collars. I get that.

But in my case, I need boundaries set over a wide range of terrain. If the dog is not on leash, or tethered to a tree, what do I do?

"" Don\'t leave home without a currency for your dog ""???\n I\'ve never had to pay my dogs off to come to me! This is laughable ‐  and shocking. Does he think dogs are stupid?  What if you don\'t have a payout when you call your dog? He\'s gonna feel cheated.  And then when you start not paying them off at all ( all of these positive, payout with treats trainers say that you can start leaving off from time to time, sometimes no treat, sometimes you give him a treat often unlike that until you\'ve just slowly wean \'em off of  the treats ) ever anymore he is gonna learn that he can\'t trust you. He\'s gonna learn that he needs to start taking over because you  Can\'t handle things anymore and he might even start bringing you dead stuff from the yard. Other unwanted behaviors might start.\n\n Bond with your dog by playing with them on the floor -  Later they\'ll be so attached to the floor and sitting at your feet they probably won\'t even jump on the furniture ,\nthink about that especially if your dog is the type that likes to get in water or mud or mud or dig in the yard and get dbut they get dirt on their paws and might come running in the house and then all over your cloth furniture\n  Watch the behavior and start giving names to the behaviors that you want when you see that they see you and they start coming across the floor to you, call their name and say come Or here, or just say the name . They will automatically associate it with the meaning of being near you and getting the praise and love and pets when you have them beside you. Speaking of beside when you\'re capturing this behavior you can automatically just sit them at your left heel and they will learn that when you called them that\'s where you want them to be so so that\'s just a 1,2,3 immediate lesson right there.\n\nThen, too,  Watch when the puppies bought the lay down and then give him that command, Then reach out and pet him and repeat the words when they do it\n\nI\'ve learned you can label everything they do I have taught my dogs to go potty on command, call it whatever you want: pee pee, poo poo, number 1 number 2, tinkie and too-too... The whole point is that when it\'s raining or there\'s hail coming down and your dog has indicated that it needs to go potty cause it really doesn\'t know what\'s going on outside with the weather you can still tell him to go do it and they\'ll go do it whereas other dogs might run out in a thunderstorm and then turn around and come right back in the house so can wet without having done the deed and they may go in the house. How long is the storm gonna last will your dog\'s bladder outlast the storm? Think about it...\n\n Whenever my dog\'s ate food I told them ""eat food"" or ""drink water""... The reason being is that if my dogs were ever feeling ill feeling ill it could be a good measure of measure of just how sick they are if I can tell them to drink water because because their symptoms indicate that they do need to drink water until we can get him to the vet or you can see your dog through a fever.. It tells just how sick they are if they\'re still willing to obey/please you, or if they are just really truly so dang sick they\'re so out of it they cannot obey you, much less care to.\n\n This all goes a long way to establishing yourself as the leader no not in that alpha dog balloney from out of the \'70s but as more of a Mamadog who\'s always gonna boss her baby around, and make sure that it is acting right - so make sure you do the same.\n\n Another thing you can do to bond is to take a nap with your dog in the floor\n\nAnother way to bond with your dog is to feed food from your own mouth as a mana dog or wolf would in the wild - it\'s instinct to chew and regurgitate to feed her babies \n Many shepherds and and the mountains of I\'ll say turkey I can\'t understand all over the Middle East still allowed their female dogs to take care of their pets naturally because really and truly they can do it better better than we think we can\n\nOr give yourself a bite and feed your dog a bite, he\'ll get the idea your sharing  the same food - and it should be the same -  hopefully some unseasoned , unsalted meat, cooked just enough to be called done.  Dogs really do need it raw because of the enzymes and stuff. They need organ meat too if you can find a fresh meat butcher. A lot of stores do carry beef livers and chicken gizzards and what not\n\n When you have that good bond you have respect you have a cooperating member of a pack even if it\'s just the 2 of you and He will do anything to protect you whatever you whatever you and he already knows that you\'re the leader so he\'s gonna look to you to know what is the right behavior, so, when you begin to teach him to stay back (on the inside of the door threshold) when you open it, and to only leave it when you tell him it\'s OK to go and the  Opposite is true too have him set and wait until you tell him to go inside the house if you\'re coming back from a walk or play time or the dog park, or whatever else he needs to do that you need to teach him he\'ll do it and he\'ll do it reliably every time as long as you are consistent. He will also learn to be by your side or at your feet always.\n If you have a nose dog he will still probably want to wander but I assure you that it will be easier to keep him near you .. recall while off-leash will be much easier.\n\n To avoid separation anxiety you must always take increasing breaks from your dog and have him on the other side of the door and you will away from it for longer and longer periods of time until your dog realizes oh,  OK so I\'m gonna be alone for a little while but they always come back.  Coming back at odd intervals of time 5 minutes 1 time increasing to 15 and then a 1/2 an hour and then come back in 5 minutes 1 time and then come back in 15 minutes 1 time and then stay gone an hour you get the idea , they\'ll learn that you will always be back.

I am thrilled with this latest iteration of the Furbo dog camera. We’ve been using it consistently recently and it’s been very reliable as well as game changing with the AI features. Considering all of the things that this camera can do, I think it’s an extremely good value personally.', 'HELP! My dogs are almost 3 years old now. They are “potty trained”. Although apparently not well enough. We live in a house with a yard. They spend more than enough time outside. We’ve also began going on longer walks about 3 times per day minimum. When they potty outside I am congratulatory. \n\nThey both utilize the bathroom in the house from time to time. One dog a lot more than the other though. At a ratio of probably 10 to 1. I “know” based on tracking their bowel movements when we go on our regular walks. It’s always in a room I’m not in a bathroom, or the living room if I’m in the bedroom. \n\nIt’s not super often. Maybe 3 times a month. But I feel like it’s definitely too often for a dog or dogs that spend as much time as they do outside and receive regular walks. They truly are not inside for long stretches at a time. If I work 8 hours they’re outside for that duration of time. And when I’m home I let them out every 2-3 hours for at least 30 minutes to an hour each time. I understand that often they use this time to play with eachother as well. Which is why we’ve started the longer structured walks. As well as “go to the bathroom” outings, where it’s me letting them out specifically to go to a certain part of the yard to utilize. We’re not outside long, a few minutes, I watch them the entire time and I give them a treat for going. \n\nI don’t believe it’s a control issue. As I said they’re selective about where they go in the house. I spray and clean thoroughly each time. And they never go in their crates. They’re both crate trained and there are times where they may be in their crates for longer stretches of time. Maybe a bad weather work day could have them in the kennel for an 8 hour stretch. And they never mess their kennels. \n\nI would LOVE to be able leave them in the house while I’m gone for shorter outings. But they will almost always use the bathroom in the house when I’ve tried that in the past. Even for extremely short stretches, running to an ATM and back. So I never leave them in the house unattended unless they’re in their crates. I don’t understand it. I have coworkers that I don’t think are as involved dog owners that are able to leave their dogs in the house all day and not have the slightest worry of coming home to a mess. I’ve made an effort. Clearly just not in an effective manner. \n\nAnother thing I thought of is it’s generally not pee in the house. It has happened. More so during the very few times I’ve tried to leave them unattended in the house. But 95% of the time it’s poop in the house if there’s an accident. I have tile and wood floors so I wouldn’t miss when they peed. \n\nAnother thing I’ve tried is literally leaving a door open for them. On nice weather days while I’m home I’ll leave a door open, either the garage door that leads thru the garage to the yard or the front door that goes directly into the yard. And STILL I will come out of my bedroom or home office to find pee on the floor in the living room 20 feet from the open door. (For some reason during these times the accidents I remember specifically have been pee more times than poo).', 'Hey Zak! Thanks so much for this update!

xwND4O6U1Sc,"['It seems to me that one of the fundamental mis-steps in communication between different types of dog training is the conflation of the 𝘦𝘧𝘧𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘴 of a particular technique with the 𝘦𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘴 of that technique, and that conflation carries with it a personal emotional investment that can make critiques feel like either personal or systemic attacks. All four of the operant conditioning quadrants are effective, and this is simply an objective fact. That fact, however, doesn\'t address whether or not there is an ethical problem with some of them. ""Balanced"" training utilizes all four quadrants, while ""positive"" training only uses two (yes, the focus is on positive reinforcement, refusing access to a rewarding stimulus until the correct behavior is presented is negative punishment). Even if the two methodologies had identical rates of effective performance (they don\'t, methods that emphasize positive reinforcement as the primary tool showed both higher levels of learning speed and retention), the question still remains: If you can train a dog just as effectively 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘵 using aversives, is it morally a problem to do so?

I\'ve seen so-called dog trainers hit dogs with rolled-up towels (looking at you, Jeff Gellman). Yesterday, I saw a ""trainer"" tell people to hit their dog with their open hand if that\'s what it takes. And people listen! And look up to these people. I truly believe a bunch of narcissists took to the internet because they saw an opportunity to feed their egos. There are so many dogs out there getting abused because these people are manipulative and convincing. It breaks my heart that social media lifts these people up and gives them a platform.', 'Keep doing what you are doing Zak❤️❤️ I love Biscuits!!', 'I would like to know what happened to Biscuits...', ""I really like your videos and think your way of training is really great. BUT I also am not against prong collars/slip leash/electro collar. It's all about balance and how you use them. There are a lot of people using them wrong which gives it it's bad name. In many cases training your way works well especially when you've got a puppy. Be a female not strong muscled person having a large grown dog that lunges, the dog can make us fall, or run onto a road getting hit, or even attack another dog/human. In those cases an immediate no that gives us control over the dog using prong is much better to keep control of dog and for training. If your dog is a hunter an e-collar can enable them to still be able and in full control off leash. Where I live there are also no fenced in fields and dog parks, so some control off leash is great. It allows them freedom while with your method it takes years or they might never be allowed to run freely. A very reactive or aggressive dog benefits from the other methods too. And they are being used in a fairly gentle way. Much better than constant pulling or keeping the dog restricted to backyard and house or giving entirely up on them. There are so many benefits to it that don't hurt your dog but help creating a much better relationship between dog and owner without the dog being afraid but actually blossoming. Aside from you, I also really like Upstate Canine Academy who is using a good balance and explaining his methods great."", ""I found you 12 years ago. My aussie mix was just 10 weeks old. I changed my training method using exactly what you encouraged. My girl is now 12 years old. I can't even count how many times I have/had people compliment me and Gypsy on her behaviour and almost human like character. We have such a beautiful relationship. You made me see Gypsy as a companion. Gypsy is the best dog I have ever had and I know it's because of you. Thank you!"", 'I use positive whenever I can. Sometimes, for my safety, the dog’,s or other people or animals, there’s no other way. You might not pop the leash, but if the dog is going to lunge, I have to brace, and the dog is going to pop herself, like in minute 22. I can’t let her drag me, because I am 70 years old and don’t want to fall. So I pop, and slowly, dog and I reach agreement. (And she’s a great frisbee catcher.)\n\nI really don’t see you as disagreeing with Beckman, et al.  And many people, including myself, look at both of you.\n\nAnd e collars and leash popping are not the same thing.

Never use the word no and leave a ton of toys all over the floor for them to guard. This is ridiculous. Saying no doesn’t scare the dog and ruin their lives. You need to condition the word in so it tells them to stop whatever they are doing or there will be some kind of consequence. Like stop growling and guarding this you or it’s going to get taken away. If I was a teaching a person a game and they were making a mistake and I said no….would they be scared and thing I was trying to terrify them? No of course not. Dogs are simple creatures, they don’t really think about things, and they certainly do not hold a grudge. Biscuits needs leadership and discipline. She needs to know that she is not in charge, that Zak is. And she needs to know she owns nothing, Zak just lets her play with the things he owns if she follows the rules. That’s how a dog learns. This style of training is horrific and is the reason dogs are being put down left and right because people refuse to say no and then can not get rid of bad behaviors so they get told their dog has a problem and put it down. It’s ridiculous. You should  be able to eradicate resource guarding very very quickly, and if you can’t, you aren’t doing it right. Watch how a mother dog communicates with her pups, or how 2 adult dogs tell each other what’s up. I’m not saying dogs think of us as dogs, but it definitely shows how dogs learn. They need yes and no just like all social beings. And the bitting. That is so easy to eradicate it’s insane. Interact with the dogs mouth. Do it a lot. Open it check their teeth, gently hold their muzzle every now and then. The dog should be very comfortable with you around their mouth. And if they nip, say no for godsake. Your dog only lives a short while people. Do you want to enjoy your time with them or wait until they naturally calm down halfway through their life? If you want the first, then be a leader who tells the dog what’s up. They can’t be in charge of their own life and live with humans. It’s your job to show them how to live through trained behaviors. Don’t berate the dog and scream at it and hit it, but be confident and consistent and mean it and say no when you need to. Ask yourselves this, could zak train a service dog or a police dog? Hell no he couldn’t. He is a living room trick trainer. But service dogs should be the model for proper training. Those are happy, calm dogs.

I have been able to get most of his anxiety behaviors under control with distance and treats. However, whenever my boyfriend comes over.. and sits next to me on the sofa then he starts acting up. He has to sit on the sofa to get calm, even though I try to get him to go to his place and stay. Also, when we go to bed.. he has to sleep in the bed with us. And in the morning, he knows he's leaving and starts barking and nipping at him. I don't want to spoil him with treats, he's almost 3 years old now. I was wondering what tactics I can do to get him to stop barking. I think it's territorial or separation anxiety barking. I have tried quiet, but sometimes that won't work. Or a spray bottle (spraying his body) or just showing it to him when he barks. Or would you recommend going back to treats? Please let me know if you have any tricks I can try.

Essentially, what Zak did with George for this training is what I\'d expect to see from a decent balanced trainer, because the basic concept of balanced training is teach the dog what we expect through positive reinforcement and what is not acceptable behavior through correction. Balanced training isn\'t always about specific tools, it\'s more about the concept of balancing ""Yes"" and ""No"" appropriately with the dog.\n\nGeorge seems responsive to verbal and physical body pressure, so given enough time and consistency he could learn leave it.

Those methods WASTE MONEY. If you are a dog trainer trying to save money,  why would you waste money on buying choke chains, shock collars (e-collars), and prong collars?\n2. Those methods PUNISH DOGS. Dogs are smart animals. Why should we use something so negative such as punishment with ""bonkers"" (according to Jeff Gellman, the guy who pretends to be a dog trainer but actually is an animal abuser,)? As Victoria Stillwell once said about shock collars, ""This is what I want to do with EVERY SHOCK COLLAR in a home."" (Uses a hammer to break them)\n3. Balanced dog training STILL PUNISHES DOGS, but punishes when a dog does something wrong. They still use choke chains, e collars, and prong collars.\n POSITIVE VS BALANCED VS NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT\n\n1. Positive training is based on YES. If a dog lies down, they get a treat. If they get up, the trainer redirects them into a lie-down, and then they get a treat.\n2. Balanced dog training is in the middle. If a dog lies down, they get a treat. If they get up, they get a painful shock collar.\n3. Negative training is based on NO. To train a dog to lie down, trainers step on the leash or push their back down. When they succumb to the pressure and lie down they don\'t get anything.

I'm not a trainer but I have extensive experience in dog ownership, rescuing and fostering stray dogs, so I don't claim to possess authoritative knowledge on the topic. I simply base my opinion on logic and common sense. Distracting a dog is akin to bribing it to leave something they're protecting for something more tempting. Once the more attractive option is removed from the equation the dog would have no reason not to continue protecting its' prized possession.

So far, with my very limited experience, I find fewer disagreements with your training methods than I find with those of other  YouTube trainers.  Would you call it Common Sense Training?   Principles of psychology work well with dogs as they do with people.  \n\nONE PERSISTENT QUESTION RE: Training dogs NOT to jump up on people.\nWhy do trainers go about all sorts of actions to stop dogs from jumping on people?  I find  that lifting my knee in front of me intercepts the dog\'s forward motion as its chest meets my knee.  The jumping stops IMMEDIATELY.  I don\'t recall having to do this more than one time. Some jumpers may return to position if they are still excited, and they  will start to raise their front legs as they are preparing to jump, and I will start to lift my knee preparing to block.  They end up rocking in position, their front legs alternating up and back on the ground.  Their position is somewhere between ""sitting pretty"" and bowing as if wanting to play, like ""approach-avoidance""  behavior.  This ""chest block"" has ALWAYS been effective for me.  Do you have an idea about its lack of use?   This action doesn\'t frighten the dogs who\'ve been stopped this way, and all remain friendly.  Why is this method so effective for me, when dog trainers don\'t use it?  My thought is that I\'m using the dog\'s own action to stop the undesirable behavior, so the action is reevaluated by the animal as not effective and it\'s discarded.  I wonder if dogs stopped this way continue to jump on other people, or do they discard it as ineffective?

As for dogs, since dog parks are now open here we regularly take her there, but we have seen the setbacks caused by COVID. She is very timid around other dogs and genuinely doesn’t seem to understand how playing works, but each time we take her she gets better and better. The first week we took her there she just sat and watched the other dogs to try and understand what they were doing, and randomly one day engaged in a game of chase. We could see that she was trying to mimic what she had seen other dogs do and it didn’t work too much in her favor, but it was some evidence to the fact that dogs do learn a lot just by watching.

The call for dog\'s attention and the REWARD for dog attention needs to be in the speed of light. Literally. Simply because after 1 second has already passed, the dog no longer understands what it is being rewarded for. Only with much repetition does the dog\'s memory of previously learned lessons stick on the long run.

We have the retrievers who retrieved downed birds for the hunter, the hounds who tracked prey with their powerful noses, the spaniels who flushed birds out of bushes, the herders who grouped cows and sheep, the livestock guardians who protected farm animals from predators and several other versatile breeds who specialized in a variety of tasks.\r\nToday, most dogs are no longer used as workers but as loyal companions who are often relegated to the yard or left at home with not much to do all day. This leaves dogs with a void to fill up. The saying “an idle mind is the devil’s workshop” fits people and dogs as well. With little left to do all day, dogs become destructive and may engage in undesirable behaviors such as digging, chewing and barking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Dog Training will help\xa0 \xa0https://tinyurl.com/yeqt38s8', 'how are all these dogs so poorly trained. 9 months and your dog ""isn\'t good"" at down wtf', 'Hi Zak.

She is 50% border collie and that is what consernes me sience I live in an apartment and peopole are saying that border collies shouldn't live in apartments. Me and my mother got her because one family's dog had had accidental pups. She was the smallest in the litter and sience we were the last ones to call them we couldn't choose one of the pups so we got her (which wasn't a problem because she was the cutest). I'm conserned about the need of exercise for the breed. I'm not that active myself (i'm 13) but I take her out around 2+ hours a day. I usually run around and play fetch with her on a football field that's on the backyard of the apartment for around 20 minutes. Then I take her on a 20-40 walk around the area. Then if she still had energy I run with her some more in the field. I do it around 4 times a day. This usually does tire her out and I usually train her once we get home. Is it enough exercise? There is also a fenced dogpark under a kilometer away from our house and I can start taking her in there daily to run around. So the question is is it enough exercise for her? I'm going to school after summer and she may be alone for up to 7 hours a day. I really wanted a dog but now i'm conserned about the breed."", ""Hey Zak, I'll be sure to follow your insta!

Animals must be with only those, that can provide them with the best care and real love.\n\nDogs are the most tortured animals in the world. Every year, millions of dogs are thrown out into homelessness. They are needlessly bred, mistreated, tortured, killed through homelessness and by pervert caretakers who breed dogs for sale or for food, leather, fur. BAN CRUELTY TO ALL DOGS. THE LAW MUST BE CHANGED. Ban using Dogs to fight. Stop chaining Dogs. Ban leaving Dogs outside in Winter and bad weather - Dogs must be with the best Caretakers in loving homes. Dog Lovers must do more, even with giving opinion. Dogs that are not wanted should be put down with morphine, if they cannot be put for adoption and taken by very loving persons.\n\nBan dog breeding. Dogs should live up to 100 years, like the Dingo's in ecological and clean nature, where soil, water, air and food were pure. Almost all shelters should be closed, except a few that are government approved and sponsored to preserve the species, and where the dogs will be bred in very small amounts for the pure love of the species - not through rape that is done by most breeders, or even forcing dogs to mate, or in-vitro which is also forcing to breed. A loving owner does not have to sterilize his pets because his/her care is so good that mating is not allowed. Sterilization is against nature, it's very painful, deprives the body of needed physiology, hormones, deprives the body of a natural way of cleansing itself and accelerated aging, also causes psychological changes that are unnatural.\n\nDogs were since thousands of years humanity's friends around the world, among all the other animals. Within the last decades, in literature, within scientific circles, among artists and also among common folks - dogs are being treated as best friends and loved the most.

The thing is, I highly encourage positive reinforcement for the woof-woof-foo-foo type of dogs, or the dogs that are learning something new, but it is almost impossible to train a dog for law enforcement or protection without the use of a prong. You never see it. Those dogs are hardcore, aggressive(not 'vicious' like people think I mean), high strung, nervy dogs that need to be trained with the use of a prong.\xa0\nThe top Military Elite dog trainers use prongs for their dogs and what do they get? Dogs that are winning the top awards in the IPO and Schutzhund trials. These dogs are perfectly fine, are well trained, and trained for self-control, confidence but they keep their wild nature. They are genetically wired to be that way, and all family protection dogs go to families fine. A dog that is bred to be very driven for fight drive and prey drive /cannot/ be bribed with food. My dog is a working line German shepherd dog, and she will be entered into the Schutzhund trials- she cannot be bribed with food. Most working dogs cannot; it's almost impossible if genetics are implanted there.\n\nNow, other than that, I do absolutely love your channel and many of your videos, as they've helped me train some awesome tricks with my dogs.""]"

So, good communication is key, if you want a dog to “follow” your lead.https://esacare.com/top-three-dog-training-myths-explained-by-14-renowned-experts/', 'The pit-bull stuff is kind of a straw man argument. It\'s not a myth, it\'s scientific fact. You can look up the data and find the pit-bulls are more dangerous than other breeds of dogs - especially to small children. That doesn\'t mean that all pit-bulls are mean. It doesn\'t mean they\'re hard to train. It doesn\'t mean they aren\'t kind, loving dogs - most of the time.\n\nMost pit-bulls have very nice personalities and are gentle and loving and intelligent and very easy to train.\n\nBut there is scientifically verifiable evidence that a pit-bull is more likely to bite unexpectedly than other dogs, and that their bites are more dangerous and are more likely to result in severe injuries with dangerous infection when they do bite. Pit-bull bites are much more likely to end with permanent debilitation or long term hospital stays than any other breed of dog - and they\'re more likely to bite.\n\nAnd it\'s a very small percentage of pit-bulls that ever have this problem. But it is still an orders of magnitude higher risk than with other dogs.\n\nShowing me a pit-bull that is a nice dog that is well trained - that\'s called anecdotal evidence. Nobody ever made the claim that all pit-bulls are horrific monsters. But it\'s also verifiable that even in nice, happy, well trained pit-bulls, there is a high instance of them being set off unexpectedly and seriously harming someone, or even killing children, without any history of them having problems with aggression prior to the attack.\n\nWhen you show me a pit-bull that has never had a problem - you\'re not picking at random. You\'re picking a pit-bull that has never had a problem. If you picked at random, most of the time you\'d still get nice dogs with no problems, but you\'d get dogs that have severely injured people far more often than with other breeds.\n\nAnd the assertion that every breed of dog is equal and all of the stuff about different breeds and they\'re just needing to be trained is horse shit.\n\n\nYes, once again, you can find anecdotal instances of any breed of dog that is well behaved.\n\nI could also find an anecdotal instance of a golden retriever who is not a personable dog and is bad with children. That one instance does not mean that golden retrievers don\'t make good family pets.\n\nStatistically, different breeds have different personality traits that are much more prevalent in that breed.\n\nChows are dicks. If you\'re looking for a good pet - don\'t get a chow. At least not a puppy. If you are getting an adult dog and you can evaluate its personality before you buy it, great. You can judge that dog by the personality it exhibits. Maybe you found the rare good chow that gets along with everyone and isn\'t mean and doesn\'t bite. But if you get a chow as a puppy - expect that dog to be a problem.\n\nI have known 1 dalmatian in my entire life that I would consider a good dog. Typically, they\'re ornery dogs with very little tolerance for people, and they\'re prone to biting and aggression toward anyone they don\'t know well.\n\nAnd as a dog trainer, no doubt you\'re capable of training these undesirable traits out of most dogs.\n\nBut that still doesn\'t mean that there is no truth to these so called ""myths"" about the personalities of certain dogs. Not everyone is a professional dog trainer. If you get a chow or a dalmatian, your dog is going to likely have many more undesirable traits that you have to train out of them. And if you\'re not a professional dog trainer, you may not be able to do it. Or it may make your dog owning experience far less pleasant, because you picked the wrong breed of dog.\n\nBack to pit-bulls. Pit-bulls do not have the same problems with aggression and biting as chows and dalmatians. Pit-bulls have an entirely different problem. Pit-bulls have a history of unexpected and unprovoked aggression from otherwise perfect dogs. And it makes them dangerous.\n\nThat doesn\'t mean nobody should own a pit-bull.\n\nBut people with young children should not own a pit-bull. It\'s not a dog that can be trusted around small children, because of verifiable scientific statistical data.\n\nAnd if you want to ignore that advice, that\'s fine. Chances are your kids are not going to be harmed by your pit-bull.\n\nBut chances are your kids are not going to die if you don\'t make them wear their seat-belt either. But you\'re still a bad parent if you\'re willing to put your kids at unnecessary risk by not making them wear a seat-belt.\n\nAnd in case it happens, if a pit-bull does bite you or someone you care about, and you can\'t get them to let go, grab the garden hose, and spray them full blast right up their butt hole. It will make them let go. Personal experience...', ""I was almost bitten by a pit bull and almost bitten by a boxer. I was terrified of them for years and would cry every time I saw one.

It adds pressure to the back of the neck rather then the front. You want to decrease a behavior that can be dangerous for your dog or dogs but give positive reinforcement like food or a toy to increase the behavior will happen again. You can’t just do positive training there has to be some kind of punishment for there unwanted behavior. For example my dog has a toilet paper tube it’s chewing on so I say no and I took away the paper tube. Negative punishment. Then I added a dog toy and when the dog started to chew on it I say yes.

Of course wolves give praise too, but the important thing is that you use corrections when necessary for example, when the dog bites gently tug their scruff and say “no”, or if you don’t like your dog barking you can spray it with a spray bottle, harmless. And there is e-collars and prong collars (I would never ever advise choke collars, those hurt for real). Those are both great tools, they don’t hurt the dog at all, just discomfort. Dogs react more strongly and more fearful to vibrate collars than e-collars. Of course I believe that everyone needs a course on how to use training collars. It gives your dog so much freedom that they would otherwise never have in the form of a recall using the e-collar. And prong collars can stop a dog from pulling like magic for people that don’t even have enough time to give praise before the dog starts pulling again.

Most examples currently out there for the 4 quadrants of operant conditioning are not examples of actual dog training and are biased and only focus on showing one way of training which is all positive reinforcement. I am for it and think it should be used but realistically trainers use other training methods even when they do not think they are. Hopefully, this will help others \n\n\n\n\nPositive Reinforcement: adding something your dog perceives as pleasant to increase a behavior  (examples: treats, toys, praise etc)  - Reward-Based Training Only \n\n\nNegative Reinforcement: removing something the dog perceived as unpleasant to increase a behavior  (This can even be the usage of gentle leaders bc dogs learn from prior experience that if they pull their head is redirected towards you. You are removing something (the pressure from the gentle leader) the dog perceives as unpleasant to increase a behavior (heel/walking closer to you) \n\n\nPositive Punishment: adding something the dog perceived as unpleasant to decrease a behavior  ( Example: When your dog pulls you apply a correction by tugging on the dog’s leash applying pressure on their martingale collar. You are adding something (the tug) the dog perceives as unpleasant to decrease a behavior (the pulling) )\n\n\n\n\nNegative Punishment: removing something the dog perceives as pleasant to decrease a behavior  (Example: If you stop walking when your dog begins to pull.

Sorry, I disagree with your stating on the prong collar- although I do dislike the choke chain and E-Collar, I can't say anything against them as that'd make me a hypocrite, but I'll continue.\n\nMy German shepherd dog, female, from strict working lines has an insane amount of drive. She is intense, loves to chase, goes in prey drive easily- you cannot 'bribe' a high prey drive dog to release, and if it does release, it probably wouldn't make a reliable working dog on the forces or Schutzhund. \xa0\nI HIGHLY respect my dogs trainer and breeder. He gives free training classes to new owners to his puppies, but also uses prong collars on those over six months old if they need it... it worked. He has taught dogs for the Military and Police force, and the WUSV schutzhund trials and so on- your opinion of a bad trainer is slightly biased, my friend.\nNOW, I am not saying I don't hate positive reinforcement. It's amazing to teach new behaviors, or distract a dog that is growling at strangers and yadayada, but you don't train Schutzhund or Police dogs- I'd like to see proof 100% positive reinforcement without a prong works on a working Malinois or GSD first, before you hate on prongs."", ""I need help my dog is scard of me when i say a command when I'm trying to train her she just goes to hide under things please help"", ""Empathy, for sure.

Sometimes two depending on his energy level. All because of you and your suggestions.', ""I walk my puppy daily. It varies from 1 mile to 3 miles depending on how much time I have. I've had three dogs before this and have done clicker training for rally and some agility play in my back yard. I never used clicker training for obedience. With this new puppy I attended a puppy K and they stress positive training. No reprimands or anything of the sort. It's a new mindset for me. Anyway, I am having so many successes. I like an off leash walking style as I do photography. I take my pup out in the wilderness with me. It's a little more loosely structured, but I need him to listen when I call. There are sometimes other dogs and people. We occasionally run into a fox or a deer. I needed a solution for this style of walking. I tie a cotton rope to his collar and let it drag. I call him and treat often when there are no distractions. When we come across dogs or people or something else and he starts to dash off, I step on the rope. Then I say his name. When he looks at me I click and treat. Then I click and treat while I attach his real leash to pass by the distraction. This has been very effective. Treats aren't quite as powerful as human beings and other dogs. The rope gives him time to think. Also, after the distraction has passed I use click and treat to get him to continue following me and when he does I detach the real leash. It is getting much easier for him to make that decision to come with me. Today I barely had to wait for him at all. Also, I can let him get out of range of my foot and he stops to look back at me and comes if called. I can see a distraction before he can, so I make sure I am close to his rope before it happens. I have a question though. Do you think training him in this way will present future problems with walking in town? Do you think it is a correction when I step on the rope? I don't feel like I do it in a way that punishes him. He just sometimes reaches the end of his boundary if he decides not to listen. Oh .. this isn't a straight work out type walk.

I bike with my dogs and have experienced this issue more than I would like."", 'p♥r♥o♥m♥o♥s♥m', ""I unfortunately had a real life situation with my old service dog Zeus. I had to do a lot of back training with him on not being dog reactive because he was around humans who refused to listen to what I asked of them while I was not in the house and he learned bad habits from their dog who by the way they train fake service dogs. So I had to reteach him practically everything and who to listen too. Before I went to the hospital with my sister and my dad to the hospital. I normally would not take both of my service dogs with me but because I for some reason didn't trust them alone at home because of the harassment I received at home from guests and neighbors I decided to bring both with me to lessen my anxiety. I didn't go inside cause we had a guest who came with us who needed a ride and I was very weak that day and I knew I wasn't allowed to take both of my service dogs in a small place like that. So I was staying outside sitting on a bench waiting. Zeus and Zenna we're totally calm. I wasn't paying attention to what was behind me but their was another service dog that came behind me and I agree obviously more well behaved than mine that day. Zeus got up and was trying to approach this dog and barking at him. I firmly held him back corrected him he stopped and came back and laid down. The lady was freaking out saying that my SDs we're fake because Zeus supposedly lunged at her dog which did not happen. She went to complain to the police and so I had to call the police myself. By the time the police came to finally talk to me. I explained to him why I was sitting out here. Yes these 2 are my service dogs and I apologized to her for Zeus's behavior I know it was uncalled for and my dog understands this. She had no right to be harassing me the way she did. The police agreed and said that if their was another problem that I would have to leave for the day and I understood that. Nothing happened and we left as soon as my dad came out. Cause I was done with the harassment and was being way overboard and understanding how she felt. Their was no need for her to treat me that way. After this experience I learned to stop taking my SDs to dog parks and do individual training and walk them on leashes more and be friends with people who are willing to help my dogs proper behavior. It was my mistake to make friends with stupid toxic people that teach their dogs bad behaviors and allow them to get away with it."", 'when i adopted my service dog when he was 3-4 months old he did great when i dropped a metal bowl and made loud noises but now when he hears loud noises he gets scared he dosent get scared when he hears other dogs he gets excited because he loves playing with other dogs and his tail starts wagging and wacking me because he has a giant tail, i took him to home depot once and he was terrified and started shaking so we went to the outside area and i asked some kids if they could pet him (for training) and he immediately calmed down and focused on me again, ive been bringing him into hobby lobby a lot and he does great until theres a little child screaming like a banshee then he gets protective because he likes kids, he also has confidence issues that we have been working on (hes slowly progressing) is there anything i can do to make him more confident? hes really calm but he gets scared easily (his name is Kitchi which means brave but sadly hes not brave at all...)', 'Love your videos, like always!❤️ Because of your training videos, my 7 month old Australian Shepherd is calm and collected in public, does not react at all with other dogs barking, and enjoys settling anywhere with me.

I realized when I bring him outside of my fence, he doesnt care for people walking by. The fence is the boundary line of when he will alert bark in my front yard. He never barks in public or anywhere else just on my property. I was thinking to training my puppy whenever he sees someone pass by to praise him (for seeing the person and not alert barking) and give him a treat (maybe starting at my front door to create distance when he sees people passing by?

gqPTj--v3U8,"['I got a question!! I\'m a first time dog owner, and what I have learned is that I suck at training because I have never practiced on a dog before. I love the idea of errorless learning and setting up the dog to succeed with every little step, but I\'m not an errorless trainer, and I keep making mistakes. I\'m kind of feeling like saying ""no"" to my dog is really helpful for my dog when I make a mistake, because it is information that they can use, because like if I accidentally taught my dog that the way to ask me to give him his toy is to bite the couch for example, I can easily undo that by telling him ""no."" I never want to punish my dog, and so far saying like ""bap bap bap"" nicely, like high pitch, kind voice, is working for like a ""quit that,"" or ""that\'s not what I meant,"" or something. But like, I can\'t give him a treat or something for listening, I tell him he\'s a good boy, but like as soon as I give him something he wants for stopping biting the couch, or deciding not to bite the couch or something, he obsesses over the couch in order to get attention. he doesn\'t even probably need that much attention, because I sit around all day waiting for him to be ready to play with me or train or walk or something lol. I just don\'t want to enforce the couch biting and counter surfing and stuff, and meanwhile it\'s reinforcing itself. I can teach him what to do when he\'s calm and sleepy, but when he is in a bitey mood, he\'s already bitten the couch before I can reinforce him for biting his toys instead. It\'s because I\'m inexperienced, like I missed the signs that he wanted to chew and play and stuff. And interrupting him always seems to turn into a game before I clue in lol. I think my dog may just be smarter than me lol. What do you do when your dog is smarter than you?? (I did block off the couch, that\'s just one example, he\'s a rescue with a lot of habits like counter surfing, pulling on leash, etc. and I\'m trying to balance between fulfilling his needs to walk and not practicing yanking my arm off and stuff like that.

A dog can't be agitated into the state of surprise that may accompany  the event of learning a new behaviour. \n\nI don't want to make videos, be known, none of that.

Too often I send them videos by very experienced trainers, on already trained dogs, on edited videos. \n\nI think filming first time, leave the warts in, lets people see how things are handled, when not everything goes according to plan.

My schnauzer could never be walked after that and had seizures on walks. Then my new puppy was attacked on leash at 12 weeks old by my neighbors dogs (her son let all 3 of them out the front door). I picked him up as quickly as possible but he was screaming, then the dogs bit me trying to get to him. He's 9 months old now and whines and pants anytime he's on leash outside, even as I attempt to counter-condition him. I can see other things that have changed about him, too. He's on anxiety medication but still has a lot of problems. It makes me extremely angry that all I've wanted was a dog I could go on walks with, and now both of my dogs were ruined by other dogs. In each scenario, I was only about 30 feet away from my own driveway when they happened. I, too, panic when I see dogs loose or people who don't have control of their dogs. I pray that someday my puppy will learn that he doesn't have to be scared on walks, but when it happens during the critical socialization period, I worry that it will have very long-lasting effects.

I have a question that\'s very important for a lot of people in my country right now, and I think you\'re the only one I trust answering it. \n\nIn Austria, a new policy was made that forbids the use of aversives in dog training. While I personally think that\'s great, it raises some questions. I\'m thinking about police dogs and protection dogs, with ""controlled aggression"" as a lot of people call it. Especially the trainers working with these dogs tend to advocate more for aversives, as the focus that e.g. e-collars can create when applied ""correctly"" creates an insane drive of compliance in a dog through escape training. Also, protection dogs need to be able to withstand hits from attackers, but a resistancy against that can\'t really be trained in a positive way, which is the ""the stick"" is a common tool for simulating incoming attacks against the dog. \n\n\nSo I\'m thinking, positive-only training is great for pet dogs. It\'s the best solutions for most problems and although difficult to do right, when applied right it truly creates a magical bond between dog and owner. \nBut for working dogs needing to perform perfectly under all circumstances and who need to perform tasks like police dogs and protection dogs need to do, I wonder if we can even create such a necessary level of performance at all using only non-aversive methods? \nAlso, do you know trainers I could look at who train dogs for jobs like that using only positive training? \n\nThanks for your time!', 'LOVE THIS!!!', 'What would you say are the 10 FISRT THINGS you should teach a new puppy?

I have a well-trained dog, meaning he knows tons of tricks and is very obedient most of the time but I have to admit I still have problem with basic recall when in public without a leash if there are other animals around. He loves playing with other dogs (he's very friendly) and if they are far enough he'd stay with me but if they come closer or towards us, especially when they run, many times it is not possible to stop him, there's no use shouting and calling because he won't turn back. In this case would you recommend going back to basics and using a long leash all the time?  My other problem with training is that when he sees the other dogs, he'll refuse taking treats because he is way too excited and more interested in that dog than treats. Even if he hasn't eaten anything that day he wouldn't be interested in my treats.. (And if he sees a cat or rabbit or bird he loses it completely, there's no way to stop him without the leash.)""]"

I have just started watching your videos and am really amazed at how you choose to train dogs in general. \n\nOur family is getting a new puppy next spring (Bernedoodle - Bernese x Standard Poodle) and I am doing as much research about training to make it as easy on the new pup, and us, as possible.\n\nI do have a question about crate/house training. I have been gathering information from a number of trainers and I am a bit confused as to how to initially crate train the pup. I am a very methodical person and I like to be able to plan things step by step. I am planning to keep a tight schedule as I have 2 weeks off of work to stay home and train the little guy as much as I can. Then my wife is taking 2 weeks off to help out with the training. The good thing is my work place is 5 minutes away from home and I will be able to come home and check in on him and release him from his pen several times during the work day. We plan on using a piece of sod as his indoor doggy toilet while left at home in his pen. After he gets his shots and is able to go outside, I will be able to take him down a few flights of stairs to a nice patch of grass outside our apartment.\n\nMy question about house training is: how will I transition from the indoor toilet to being able to take him out when I come home i.e. eliminating the use of the indoor toilet? As we plan on using grass as his potty, it will be harder to tell if he's peed or not during those 2 to 3 hours I am at work. Is it simply seeing that he has not had any accidents for a certain period of time, then we can ditch the indoor toilet?\n\nI have read from Ian Dunbar that you need to get your puppy used to being in a crate as much as possible, as quickly as possible, and that you should basically have the puppy in the crate with a stuffed kong for an hour at a time, then let him out for a pee/poo every hour on the hour, playing or training for short intervals in between. This sounds a bit extreme to me. My question about the crate is this: if I am going to be away from my pup for 3 hours or so at a time while he is in a pen with a bed, toys, and a toilet, is it necessary to train with the crate as described above? I can't figure out what would be best for our pup, but want to do whatever will make the pup feel at ease once he is left alone for longer periods of time.\n\nIf anyone has any experience or advise to share I would really appreciate it.\n\nKeep up the good work Emily!"", 'Great tips, definitely need to revisit this as we have encountered an issue now that one pup went blind, any tips for blind dog training?', 'I would love for you to do a video on how you make time to train all six of your dogs.

Though, he freaks out when someone approaches to pet him.  I have also noticed, when people come into our house he is much better with hum, though he is very skittish and backs away immediately if they reach their hand out or move in any way - the good thing is he is still very curious and approaches them himself anyway. We don't force him to do anything. Most of the time, he warms up to guests in our house fairly quickly. I have tried everything from giving strangers treats to toys, but he is just so scared.

Never eats critters that he has killed, and seems very disappointed when they just lay there.', 'Thank you, excellent video!', ""I've been teaching the dog calm settle in a park and he's good at staying down, but stares quite intensely at other dogs walking by, is this fine or should I move further away so that he's completely bored?"", ""Wouldn't this be counter productive for say, a hunting dog, ratting dog, or other dogs whose job it is to catch prey? How would you go about training a recall without altering their prey drive?"", ""I unintentionally completely desensitized my high prey drive greyhound to cats outside withouth using any rewards or corrections. When he first came to us after we adopted him he'd freeze and/or lounge whenever he saw a cat and would be completely fixated. I would in the beginning try to pull him away, but he'd resist a lot and I'd have to drag him which didn't seem healthy to do. Ofcourse no treat, toy or praise could snap him out of it. I ended up just letting him look at the cat for...forever. After about 30 minutes to an hour he'd usually eventually decide to stop staring at the cat or would sniff a bush and that's when I took the opportunity to take him along. Sometimes after a few steps, he'd look back and do the same, but I'd just wait it out again. I'd do this every walk. Throughout the period of a few months I noticed it'd take him less and less time to decide to stop fixating on the cat. Sometimes I'd even let him go after the cat (on a leash) and have him take a look from the cat closer by or have him sniff where the cat was. In the beginning he was super eager to do this, but after a while you could tell that cats simply became a boring thing to him. He'd see them multiple times everyday for months and months, while being allowed to look at them forever. Now, 2 years later, he has almost 0 interest in cats and seems to actually avoid them. He really just wants to continue his walk whenever he sees one. No corrections and no rewards were used. I can recall him perfectly around cats, not because I thought him recall around cats, but because he is just not interested in them. Of course recall would not have worked the first day I got him. I did not expect his preydrive for cats to diminish like this, but by allowing him to fixate on cats so often for such long periods I actually unexpectedly ended up with a dog that has no interest in them. Currently his preydrive is still high towards rabbits, but I assume that's simply because we see them a lot less often and because rabbits tend to run away as soon as you spot them. When we go to a petshop and I let him stare/fixate on the pet rabbit behind the glass, he will after 10 minutes get bored and do something else. We also have budgies in our room. When we first got him he'd jump up at the cage and or would stare at them all the time. Sometimes he'd get bored, but whenever they made a noise he'd fixate on them again. We did not let him jump the cage, but we'd allow him to fixate on the birds all day long. You can imagine now, years later, the birds are like air to him. So are all other birds outside."", ""Sweden!

6Ww6r_5tSH0,"['You might be wondering, how is it possible to know what to do in the training plan for behavior modification if you don’t “SEE” the actual problem?  And the answer is, that if you see a dog over threshold it doesn’t tell you much at all.  What you need to do is expose the dog to the different aspects of the triggers where the dog has no reaction then gradually increase the intensity of the triggers, as you train you find out what are the different aspects the dog was reacting to, but in a very methodical way where you can see just the beginning of the behavior like the dogs ears perking forward, rather than letting the dog react.  (I will be making videos on this method in the future) The goal in training is to have no reactions but of course there might be times when the criteria is a little too high, but the reaction should look very mild compared to what the dog previously would do.  I think it’s perfectly fine to show mistakes and what to do when you raise criteria too high or if the training session has gone on too long.  But I don’t believe in setting the dog up to react to something so that you can film the behavior. \n\nAgain, this is my humble opinion and I am not discrediting anyone who believes differently.', 'Sounds a lot like a perfect opportunity to suggest “trust me, this dog was wild and out of control. We fixed it”. How do we know those aren’t elementary level behavior issues. Cesar is 100% about the welfare of dogs, wether you agree with his methods or not. He’s much more about reaching the humans though. Sometimes, to relate to the dog owners situation, who may be facing having to get rid of a family member that they’ve had for 5 years because they don’t know what to do or have $5000 to pay a “trainer” to “fix” the dog, you might have have the owners do what they normally do to see what your dealing with. Having it on a TV show isn’t the issue. I love “force free”, “PP”, LIMA when it works. I’ve studied Cesar for over 15 years and have applied the philosophy to over 1,000 dogs, mostly powerful breed with serious behavior issues, bite cases etc.. I’ve saved sooo many dogs and would never have known what to do without seeing these different behaviors. The why is as important to me as the what. I’m all about dogs 24/7, but in my experience in the dog world the biggest disappointed is the talk without the walk. Most people in the dog world, owners or people that work with dogs, rarely even discuss dog behavior. Atleast you’re talking about it.

I can’t just take the food bowl away for management as she will be “fearful” she will never see the food again. Your article literally had no training information in it. Not sure what these comments are talking about. Why make a whole video promoting an article? Why not just use a video to demonstrate how to train your dog…. 🙃', 'Kikopup, not sure if you\'re responding to comments but I wanted to run something by you in case you happen to comment on questions as I\'m looking for guidance. I have a 10 month old malamute who has pretty mild object guarding. He only seems to guard things that are very small though. For instance, a 12"" bully stick is not guarded at all, however when it gets down to say 4"", he acts pretty protectively of it (not growling if you approach or anything, only if you were to try and take). I have followed the steps in the book ""Mine"" and have been running through the whole 35 step process for 2 days now (I was just doing basics previously, drop trade give etc.). So with a sample large toy he was fine all 35 steps. For a 12"" bully stick I did all 35 steps (just taking the object from different angles/distances/durations etc) and he was absolutely great even when dug in. He\'d give it up and get a duck heart. Once it got down to about 5"" or so though, I walked around the room, put my hand into the ""zone"" and took it and rewarded. He initially did show a small reaction, kinda like an attempt to snatch onto the item more tightly but then right after let go. No growl or anything though. Do you have any advice on how to combat the guarding of ""small"" things. The main thing he guards is stolen contraband. A sock, napkins, paper towels, etc which happen to be small items (I\'d be more than happy to just let him have them to avoid conflict, but he ingests everything), and as far as positions go, the counter-conditioning i\'m attempting is while he\'s sitting on a dog bed with the object as opposed to him standing hunched over it. He seems to be more bothered during the latter. Example of what I was doing a lot of today following the program in ""Mine"": https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uFloMvOeY4g7tq4u-B_Om1NzAC_MSEab/view?usp=sharing (Also please let me know if i\'m making any mistake in the exchange)\r\n\r\nFor reference. He began guarding at 3 months when I did all the wrong things when he\'d find bad things outside (bones, garbage, etc.). After wrestling chicken bones away from him for the 3rd/4th time he eventually started growling. Eventually he snarled aggressively and bit me when I tried to take a piece of drywall out of his mouth from behind when he was hunched over it. I had been fighting him to trade for it for like 3 minutes or so, did all the warning signs growling/snapping first. It barely broke the skin but based on the sound he made I took that incident seriously and started managing his environment and doing trade/drop/give. Never bit again but grumbles sometimes when he knows I don\'t want him to have something, like shoes he picks up in the mud room and what not. The main reason I really want to nip this in the bud is because while I\'m managing his environment way better and doing trades and what not, I don\'t ever want an incident with an 80lb mal where a child (anyone really) goes to grab something he\'s hunched over. I don\'t know if he\'d bite or if not (and if so how hard) because he\'s more comfortable now, but I don\'t really want to find out. The nasty snarl he did during the 3-month old incident was enough to kinda freak me out a bit. In most cases, is it possible with continued training to get to a point where I can take something he\'s hunched over without the risk of a reaction? I guess that is really the biggest question on my mind, is can there be a light at the end of the tunnel with this issue to get him to a point of not reaction, or is it more just some dogs you can only do your best to manage the situation?  Also, he doesn\'t guard kibble, locations, people, etc. Just stolen contraband and almost finished food objects (bully/pig ear). I\'ve heard some malamute owners tell me they had similar issues and they grew out of it with time, but everything I read kinda points to that not being a thing. \n\nWeird part is you\'d never in a million years guess that this pup has that issue. Anyone he meets runs right up to them for belly rubs and cuddles. Sweetest dog on earth, just unfortunate that we are dealing with this. Also I don\'t mean to be dramatic either, he really has only ever had 1 incident where he nipped, but I just want to fix it! I love this dude more than anything and I want to do whatever it takes.

I've tried several things but he's not my dog, and ultimately things like holding him back until all food was finished, or muzzling him until then, was called off, and it culminated in him attacking our four pound chihuahua today.  Fortunately, the chihuahua came out with just a torn ear and messed up nose, but... the one who actually owns them both (a family member) is so mad, she can't see straight, and I am hoping to find something she will let us try.

Our puppy rescue used to pick up everything on the ground when on walks, sometimes dangerious things you can't see, so I feel like we've inadvertently reinforced that fear of something of value getting take away (as in, removing chicken bones from her mouth so she doesn't eat them). She only guards things she chews for longer - a carrot, and bone, a dental stick. We managed to reinforce leaving things outside and she now often happily does that and waits for some good treat from me. At home, she at least no longer runs around the flat trying to find a place to hide and feels more comfortable to just start eating things. I tend to leave her be, she stopped growling with the dental sticks as we play with them often too, but is still defensive. I have a fear of guarding dogs (our staffie during my childhood used to be very guarding and then once I had to hide from him in hte balcony), so it's an upsetting things to have to work through with Mooncake, but I'm trying. Sometimes I will just come and stand at a distance she doesn't show guarding behaviours at, tell her she's a good girl and she continues calmly chewing.

But is it in line with the idea of training by reinforcing behavior. No. It is not.   When you start adding in physical or psychological intimidation into your training, even the mildest, you change a simple picture into a very complex one.  It is no longer easy to tell why an animal isn’t performing a specific behavior.  And by mixing intimidation and reinforcers, you can water down the reinforcement value of your reinforcers causing you to have to turn to harsher and more frequent intimidation… because the “reinforcement is not working”.  Punishment for incorrect behavior implies that the animal did something wrong rather than the training plan being badly thought out, so if you didn’t break the steps up correctly for the dog to learn, the dog is punished rather than the trainer.  \n\nThe side effects of mixing physical and psychological intimidation into training is that you water down the reinforcers you use in the process, making them not as powerful.  This makes it difficult to work with your dog when you are competing with other reinforcing things in the environment as the dog can seem like he doesn’t really want to be around you or what you have to offer and prefers the other things over you. And it can seem like your dog is “blowing you off”, being stubborn, or not listening because he is naughty.  The only option you then have is turning to more intimidation and punishment to get your dog to listen and stay with you.\n\nThe problem with main stream dog training such as shows on tv, is that you will be told what you want to hear and what agrees with what you already know to keep you listening and engaged.  You want to hear that you simply just say “No!” or throw something at your dog to get them to behave.  Easy peasy just what you wanted to hear.  If it was as simple as that to change behavior without behavioral or psychological side effects, then there would be no jails because we could just tell those who have committed a crime “No” and threaten them to not do it again. \n\nThe truth is, the training plan that will be the most effective with the least amount of side effects isn’t something easy or what you already believe to work.  If so you probably wouldn’t be still having the issue.  Sometimes the most effective solution, does involve a time commitment and careful planning of a behavior modification plan.  It is, of course always disappointing to find this out.  That you actually have more work and learning to do than you anticipated, but do you want to be fed the truth or keep sailing down the river of being fed what you want to hear?', ""Thank you so much kikopup.

She has also made a habit of sniffing hands to see whether you have a treat or toy before she decides to do the behaviour.

She pants, hides, shakes and whines and is completely unresponsive. I worked with a trainer and I have tried desensitization and tried working with tapes but she knows that the tapes aren't the real thing. We also practice relaxation, I used your tips on settling as well as the calm chin rest. We even tried medication (Sileo) and other alternatives like adaptil. Normally I'd gradually get her used to stimuli that set her off but with thunder, there's just no way to do that :( Unfortunately, once the stormy season starts, she will connect the thunder to EVERY loud sound in the enviroment, like planes, cars, loud music etc. She's became scared of the sound of rain because she connects it with thunder.

He will take, but drop as soon as he takes and no amount of practice so far has led to him increasing duration. At best, he will 'take' several times, dropping the object almost instantly each time and then either grow frustrated and refuse to do it anymore regardless of how high value the reward is or keep going while attempting to find other ways (throwing the object towards me in a more forceful manner, for example).""]"

Please help.."", ""Hi there.\n\nI just got a belgian malinois two weeks ago fom a previous owner she \xa0is 4 years old.\nSince it's a sheperd dog up to now i have always counetered any behaviour i didn't want like growling/barking at other dogs jumping up or eating stuff outside like grass with physical force of my own.\nIf she jumped up i would grab her paws put her down on the ground and tell her to sit in a raised voice. when she barked to or went after a dog ot tried to eat something off the street i pull her away by pure force or grab her by the neck to pull her on her side and holding her there untill she calmed down.\n\nI did this because everone around me said ''She is your pet you are the boss make that clear to her that you are stronger and above her''.\n\nBut i think this was the wrong way to try to teach her i picked up a clicker on the way home and i'm going to some of your methods i hope emphisizing good behaviour instaed of just punishing her harshly for the bad stuff will do the trick.\n\nvideos like these aree gonna help a lot with that i think so thanks for taking the time to make them."", 'nice! new vid', ""When training like this, I'm always afraid to give too many treats to my dog. :/"", ""Dogs in these videos are always so placid.

IOhpr3NO3TY,"[""ok so I understand where this idea comes from. I'm a human who has phobias, and my phobia is reinforced on an automatic level. When a fly lands on me, I panic, and then my brain decides the reason that I survived the fly landing on me was because I panicked, so the next time it happens, I panic more, because my brain thinks that is the way to keep me safe. So if dogs are like humans in that way, by letting the dog panic the behaviour of panicking is being reinforced I guess, because they lived, and then if you expose them to the thing they're scared of in a small enough measure/degree that their nervous system is capable of like calming itself down, and if the dog is like, trying to calm itself down, then if they have success, their brain will have taken a teeny step towards not being scared of that thing anymore. Because it didn't panic, and the dog lived. So when you add something like cuddles and treats, 1. you're making it into a less scary version of the situation by being there, protecting them, showing them you're calm and you don't think its scary, and then 2. you're motivating them to calm themselves down. If dogs are anything like people, they can't really enjoy their food or move their bodies freely or play or have fun or relax when they're scared, like they do but it's like compulsive they don't like enjoy it, so they have to try to calm themselves down if they want to play with you or relax or have fun, that makes them want to be calm around the scary thing. Like when you're scared of something and you do a silly dance, those things are kind of incompatible in your body because you can't be tense, trembling, ready to fight or flee, protecting your body, watching for threats, and chances are it won't be fun and you won't really be able to, or else if you succeed, it might actually make you feel less scared because you're not physically doing the scared things in your body. I feel like your mind has to decide not to be scared AND your body has to decide not to be scared. If your mind decides and your body doesn't, your mind will start listening to your body, and vice versa. So you can help your dog that way too, just like encouraging his mind to want incompatible goals and his body to do incompatible behaviour"", 'this makes a lot of sense', 'You are the best! here in Mexico many dogs are afraid of the cuetes, the fireworks that all neighborhoods have in their yearly festivals.

I work only with +reinforcement and have seen what the impact it has on modifying behaviour!!!!', ""Hi. Just some thoughts...you cannot reinforce something that feels unpleasant, correct. But that is not the argument that is made.   The argument, (whether you agree with it or not), is that the praise and consolation and comfort the dog gets when he behaves clingy or needy or whines is reinforcing because it relieves some of the stress from the fear of the stimuli. so instead of learning the skill of coping or getting desensitized to the stimuli that's causing the fear, the dog instead learns to immediately seek out comfort and consolation from the closest human when something scary is happening. That is reinforcement.  Oddly enough I think that would actually count as negative reinforcement because the stimulus is presented the dog feels stressed and offers the behavior of seeking consolation and feels relief from the stress. I think the argument is that that  this is not a good thing. Rather than have a dog climb into your lap whining and trembling to feel better during a thunderstorm, it is better to teach the dog to lie down on a mat or do touch for treats (just as a random example).  The end result of consoling a dog who is fearful is you plateau at them needing to be consoled when they are fearful.  What do they do if there's no one present? The end result of distracting to an alternate behavior that is rewarding instead of consoling as that the dog may not be fearful in the first place the next time that happens."", 'My dog osnt calmed by handling when fireworks are around, sadly', 'I love all your information; on this one i wish you had started with the end (not to act anxious/scared yourself) Attitude is so important, letting your dog know all is well by acting like all is well.

This is some great info for our first family doggo!', ""Thank you so much for this video! You shared so many great ideas I hadn't thought of! I've housetrained two dogs and wanted to study up since I applied to adopt a rescue that's two years old and not yet housetrained. I've been through the crazy early weeks of hourly walks throughout the night to crate train a really young puppy and I'm ready for anything because when you put in the work it pays off!! This was incredibly helpful and I took notes with a few questions sprinkeld in!\n\nQuestion: My six year old pup is a pro and doesn't even know how to use a wee wee pad :) She's so good about going outside, I can probably count on my hand the few times she's had accidents. Do you think that will help get the new dog into a routine?\n\nAnyway here's my top takeaways :\n\n1- if you see the dog peeing in the house, call them to go with you and go outside -- disrupt what theyre doing to show the right behavior. Already believed in the importance of positive training and creating a level of trust so the dog isn't scared of making mistakes in front of me but REALLy helpful to hear the idea so I can take action in the moment and use a mistake as a helpful learning experience. \n*My instinct would be just to hide my emotional reaction and remove the dog to another closed off area so I could clean up immediately and prevent any lingering odors...I guess it's more important to take the training opportunity and take a hit for the clean up?\n*Also, what about if you live on the 20th floor in an apartment and there is inevitably a 2 minute wait to get outside? Is it hopeless to try to get them to finish peeing outside by then or still worth it to reinforce the right behavior?\n\n\n\n\n2-Use Nature's Miracle to douse area with enzymatic cleanser to train the dog that the area of peeing is not a toilet. Use that area to associate it with training or put a water bowl!!\n\n3-Just because they peed on leash doesn't mean they won't pee 15 minutes later or during lull in activities\n\n4-Walk them through the areas that they would be tempted to pee on in the house as you're on the way out so they can practice not choosing that place!"", 'Thank you for the information!

I hand feed him most of the time, holding his bowl and letting him eat from it. If I ask him to leave it, he does. He is on a raw food diet and eats enough. I can't drop a piece of meat in between his paws as you recommended since, well it is meat. He sense the meal times and gets super arroused. I wait until he calms down but that never happens.

He has learned some commands (FINALLY!) like sit, lie down, excuse me, no, and working on leave it. However, meal time comes around and no matter what we have tried, he is so excited that he cannot calm down and chokes himself in his attempt to eat approximately 4-6 cups of kibble in one bite without chewing or breathing.

To me, that sounds like positive-only training. I am a big fan of marker training, and think that combining operant conditioning and markers gives your dog the easiest, clearest way to understand what you\'re asking of them, as well as making it fun for them to do and retain. My biggest frustration with positive-only training is seeing a dog and/or trainer getting bored or frustrated because the dog doesn\'t understand what the trainer wants, and the trainer refuses to correct the dog where it\'s messing up to make things clearer for the dog. So many simple things can be fixed without being mean, I guess I just don\'t understand sitting around and waiting for the dog to figure it out so you can reward the behavior when you could tell the dog you don\'t like the bad behavior, then show it the good behavior and praise and move on.

(We made it easy for the dog with the set-up, and I think did build confidence throughout the game, but probably didn\'t have as many layers as you would have used). It was interesting to see that while shaping took a little longer than luring at first, the behaviors that we taught through shaping were more solid (quicker to do the behavior, easier to build duration, and more quickly generalized) than the lured behaviors.\n\nI look forward to the deeper dive into the ""why"" behind your favorite training methods! :-)', 'Capturing behavior when Helsie goes out of the pool and shake out the water we say shake shake shake and now she does it on one cue!', 'Very comprehensive discussion.

Since you generously ask for concrete wishes...\nAre you planning to also teach Belief some obedience skills at some point by any chance...?!? 🙂 that would be awesome! I'm aware Belief is barely 4months old, but it would be so valuable to see how you start setting the grounds for this kind of work - like RZ as baseline for Heelwork - and what do we have to pay attention to when we want to raise a great family pet who might as point also be active in sport. \nOne skill I'd love to have fresh input on would then be for example how to teach the puppy to run away from you in a straight line (I think it is called 'sendaway'). If you were to teach Obedience to Belief at some point, would you start now already sending him away from you (e.g. to a toy etc.) or would you say a young puppy has to first learn to come to me (and not run away)?

In shaping we do manipulate the environment to help the dog offer the right behaviour to start with (unless we free shape), so I guess the treats at the table edge could also be seen as manipulation... could you help us understand where do you set the borders between manipulation and luring?  \nThe differentiation is for me (early career trainer ;) ) not always so neat... thank you so much!!!"", 'What breed is she??', 'Which toy are you using?', 'I wish I had found you 3 years ago...', ""That is so brilliant!

I think her emotional responses occur when she hears a dog barking, especially if it isn’t one of the yards where we usually hear them.

We also taught a release word (""break"") for when we weren\'t using the clicker. What do you think of that method?

Well done team!', ""Hi Susan and Team. I'd love to know which countries in Europe that it is compulsory for a dog to wear a muzzle when being walked down the street. I know that in the Victorian age in the UK it was compulsory but that certainly isn't the law today. Many European countries stimulate that muzzles should be worn by large dogs on public transport though I have to be honest, I have yet to see that being enforced (I have visited 37 out of 44 European countries). The only country that I know that has recently instigated a muzzle law (public transport, in front of schools and kindergartens) is Austria (with the option of  implementing to non built up areas). I'm saddened that you may be using such click bait tactics - hope I've misunderstood and would love to hear your thoughts on what image you were transmitting to your followers."", 'Thank you again and again for all your inspiring advices helping me and my dogs to find a better way in learning good things!!!!', ""Initial thoughts before watching the video: Make sure you know how to fit your dog's muzzle properly! Many people improperly fit their dog's muzzle (not purposefully of course) which can cause health issues and increased anxiety. It's important for dogs to be able to drink, take treats, and fully pant in their muzzle. Dogs are not nearly as effecient as humans are at cooling themselves down, panting is their main cooling method. They need to pant, and the muzzle needs to have extra room so they can freely open their jaw in a relaxed full pant. Also, make sure to go for a basket muzzle, biothane muzzle or a jafco so that there's some air circulation. Avoid fabric muzzles that hold the mouth shut for 3 main reasons: 1) Dogs can't cool themselves down properly 2) No matter how well conditioned it is, having your mouth kept shut for extended periods of time is uncomfortable and can be scary (imagine not being able to open your mouth when you want/need to!) 3) they're NOT bite proof or scavenging proof. \n\nThis podcast probably covered this info, but I thought I would include just in case. If the Dogs That team sees this comment, and the info is not in the podcast, maybe consider including it as many many people make muzzle fitting mistakes which can be detrimental to their dog's wellbeing!

I  learned about you recently and am catching up with all podcasts. Do you have any tip on how to behave when a dog knows the cue I say but doesn’t do it? I have a puppy who knew perfectly well how to drop toys when we play and suddenly she stopped doing that. I don’t think anything has changed in my behaviour which could cause her to decide that she doesn’t want to drop the toys anymore. Is her motivation too low now? She’s a brilliant 6 month old puppy if this helps. Thanks for your input.', 'In the retriever world,  Dennis Voigt (another Canadian) coined ABC: Attitude, Balance, Control.  From Dennis: ""Attitude is critical. Your dog has to have a good attitude to learn. He has to be excited about playing the game. He cannot be over-excited to the point of being in a frenzy. Everything you do must be tempered by your dog’s attitude. If he has a sour attitude that should be your priority to change. If he is a wild man, you need to temper it. If he has a good attitude you need to maintain it.  Attitude is everything.\n\r\nBalance means seeking the over-all all-around dog. Your dog needs to be balanced in work on land and water, on marks and blinds, on simple and complex, on multiples and singles on simple blinds and diversions, on drills and field set-ups, on free decision-making and compliance, on excitement and control, on technical and drive, and so much more.\r\n\nControl means compliance and tractability and willingness to be a partner. It means steadiness and playing the game with us rather than just to get the bird. It is so easy to lose control while achieving attitude and balance. In reality when you lose control you have lost balance-- I know-been there-done that- too many times with high-powered high talented dogs!\r\n\r\nABC should guide all your training sequences.\r\nSequences are often great if we theme a concept such as angle entries or drive or check down during the day but sequences always should involve ABC also. For example, I do not believe in always doing marks before blinds each day. In reality sometimes blinds are better done first thing in the morning when dogs are full of go. Then again, in an all-age stake, you are often required to do a blind first thing Saturday morning in an all-age stake-be prepared!. Your dog needs to be in balance and ready to handle anything. He needs to run down the shore and not get in early but also angle in when required. That is what balance means.\r\n\r\nSo don’t look for automatic formulas but ask yourself what does my dog need for A, B and C?\r\nABC requires thinking about YOUR dog and not just some formula that somebody has found works for their dog!""', 'Short and sweet😁👍❤️', 'Love the videos! 🥰']"

I’m crying with you Susan; I lost my boy Boschie to lymphoma over 4 years ago, its a tough journey to take with them, and even tougher to learn to live without them. For anyone going through something similar I am sending my love. While Boschie was going through his treatment I found the following poem by Emily Dickinson: “Hope” is the thing with feathers - That perches in the soul - And sings the tune without the words - And never stops - at all”', 'I am a balanced trainer and I would like to quickly point out, \n\n#1 We would never use anything but positive only to train tricks like agility. Whoever is using punishment to do that is not a balanced trainer. Personally I only correct a dog when doing so will save or potentially save the dog’s life or improve their quality of life with the owner. \n\n#2 The whole “balanced training isn’t real because balanced trainers spend too much time rewarding their dogs” argument is extremely stupid and you know it.\n\n#3 -P is almost entirely useless and it’s clear you don’t really understand it. In your example of removing a fence running dog from the backyard, you would actually be negatively reinforcing the dog. The ability to run the fence would be removed, but the behavior would be reinforced through frustration. The only time -P is even somewhat useful is when teaching the beginning stages of something like leave it or stay.\n\n#4 Most people don’t understand +P and -R. +P is correction, -R is more or less escape training. People get those two mixed up. Here’s an example, I’m sure you’ve heard that prong collars make dogs more aggressive right? The positive only people would have you believe that it’s because the dog associates the discomfort from the collar with the other dog. But in reality what happens is a clueless person puts the prong collar on their dog and ends up negatively reinforcing the dog’s behavior. Basically the person thinks they are using +P when they are actually using -R, without understanding either, and end up rewarding the dog for reacting which makes it become worse. But most of the time -R is used in conjunction with +R to teach simple things like leash pressure and sit. +P is most often used with +R to stop simple behaviors like jumping on people and leash pulling.', 'It is a very brave thing to say: ""I am human, I made a mistake and I am sorry"".

Mimi had no understanding that what she was doing was painful to us and we did nothing to indicate it to her. \n\nSince then I\'ve marathoned your podcast and absorbed and implemented every lesson and ethos. After yelping and stiffening a few times and getting the rest of the people in both households to, as well as implementing ""its your choice"", she\'s realized her bites are not nice for us and now will only ""gum"" us, or if she accidentally nips she immediately retracts and goes back to her toy or bows her head and boops with her nose where she bit as an apology (which we celebrate and go back to playing).\n\nNow at 3 months she\'s going through obedience 2 and intro to dog sports with dogs nearly a year old and sits (with stay integrated) on a hot spot with us walking a significant distance away before being ""freed"". She even ""drops it"" happily on command without a lure. Your methods have been so effective she learns almost anything we teach her in 1-2 tries and loves demonstrating that she\'s learned.\n\nI\'m so happy and grateful that we can simultaneously teach her what we need her to learn, and make sure she is living her absolute happiest life, because I never intend to give her an exasperated or angry timeout ever again.

F7iol9dRZjY,"['It is about functional character', ""My friend's family has two dogs that are reactive and especially the younger of them has learnt this behaviour from the older one. She barks and lunges at new dogs and is very stressed out and it's becoming problematic since she is a relatively big dog. I have a very calm and confident dog, he is maybe not always the best at reading other dogs or using his body language in an appropriate way, but he's always really calm or happy around new dogs. He's old so he probably wouldn't be too affected, but I think there's a risk that the other dog would be barking at him if we tried to go for a walk just because she is so reactive. Would it still be okay to try going for a walk or would it just stress out the reactive dog even more?"", 'Really cool! I think my 1year 8mo aussie Liris probably would ""relax"" more and be more balanced on our walks if she is accompanied by a confident, cool dog. Thanks for giving this advice! I sometimes consider getting a second dog (which would be like an anchor dog, the dog feeling safe around society and being confident). But the risk of having the other dog getting the same feelings towards the outside world as Liris makes me not do it. Liris barks at other dogs (if i dont have food with me) and is insecure with people but we can pass them by now, children too luckily. But I still get a bit tense myself due to previous experiences. She also reacts alot on wildlife. :)', ""While out on walks, my dog Boris and I encounter many other dogs. If Boris gets barked at by one, he comes to my side and gets a treat. We've also been working on when he sees another dog, to come into RZ and get a treat. This helps present Boris as a calm dog, that isn't lunging and barking at the end of the leash like so many other dogs we encounter.\nOne of these dogs, a big black lab, gets guided out of Boris' sight and still barks and lunges towards us. On a recent walk, we passed a couple times on the trails, then found ourselves together and going the same direction along the street. The owner then asked if we could walk together, on opposite sides of the street, and see if her dog (his name is Bo), could eventually calm down to allow Boris to approach. She told me that Bo had had a bad encounter with a large dog when he was young, getting a dew claw ripped off among other painful injuries. So, his confidence around big dogs was lacking, and he lashed out at them. Smaller dogs seemed to be okay, though.\nWe walked and talked, and occasionally brought the dogs together, and moved apart again as necessary. Boris stayed at my side, sat when asked, held his tail up, and remained calm as we walked. When they came close, and Bo started barking, Boris did respond with his own barks, and I watched the TEMP of both dogs (tails up and wagging was a good sign). I made sure to keep Boris' leash loose, so he presented an non-threatening posture, and he came back to my side when I asked each time. \nEventually the dogs were able to get close enough to sniff each other.  Boris seemed to adopt a non-offensive pose, and Bo was able to settle down and not bark while they were close. As we neared the end of the walk, they could stand side-by-side, and perform normal dog greetings and sniffing. Bo's owner was quite thankful, and we'll be sure to work together more on future encounters. \nThis made me think on this podcast, of how a calm and confident dog can provide an anchor to another dog who may be less confident. Boris has definitely gained the confidence to be that anchor dog, and his good behaviour is definitely being noticed by others in our new neighborhood. Not only has Recallers been an important tool in achieving this with Boris, but all of Susan's other available materials in Blogs and Podcasts. I'm happy that we can be able to help other dogs gain the confidence to feel safe and comfortable around other dogs."", 'What if you don’t have someone to handle the anchor dog separately? How can you use an anchor dog successfully if you are walking both the anchor dog and the dog growing in confidence at the same time?', 'This is such a great idea.

We didn’t realize this until my old dog passed away and we were left with an anxious, somewhat directionless pup.  Then the whole Covid thing started.

My puppy is quite nippy (working on this) and at his first vet visit, his vet made a comment saying how dominant he was because he didn’t like being put on his back. That comment made me think back to watching a dog trainer on TV who spoke about dog dominance often. From then on, every nip and inconvenient thing my puppy did, I saw as him trying to dominate me. I would flick him in the muzzle when he tried to nip me, or I would try and put him in an “Alfa roll” to show him who was boss. Very shortly after this (only a couple of days) I noticed my puppy’s behaviour becoming more and more aggressive and the nipping was getting worse. I went to google to try and learn better techniques as to how to dominate my puppy because clearly he wasn’t about to let me be the Alfa. Luckily I found out how outdated this dominate theory is and I stopped that right away. At the same time I also came across many great trainers on YouTube who follow a positive reinforcement theory, Susan being my absolute favourite and the one who I consistently recommend to a couple of other friends who also have a puppy. The irony of all of this is that I am a parent to 2 young kids, and as a parent I don’t follow punishment based parenting theories either. I don’t know why my approach to dog training would be so opposite, but I’m happy to say that I feel so great in my dog training approach now because it aligns with who I am as a person and as a parent to my kids.', ""So what about a puppy that is in classes from the time they got the puppy - their first pup/dog ever and it's now a 9 month old Pit Bull, that launched up, bit the trainer on the flabby part of the arm - with intent (although didn't break the skin)?  They want the dog to be a therapy dog.  Have another student, also wanting a therapy dog, whose dog is really great most of the time, she does have amazing control and the dog is in tune to her, the dog growls occasionally at her and other people.

I am truly trying to learn, understand, and share knowledge about dogs and dog psychology, so I hope you do consider my comments and my honesty. :)\n\nI\'m also curious about the ""It\'s Your Choice"" game. Is that not a form of punishment? The handler will stick out their hand with something yummy, and when the dog reaches for it, they will close their hand. It\'s teasing. It can cause frustration and confusion. It\'s the use of negative punishment to train, taking away something the dog wants to get rid of a behavior you don\'t like (which is reaching for food without permission). Sure, it\'s paired with positive reinforcement, but, the learning comes primarily from punishment. And there\'s a degree of frustration and confusion involved. The same impulse control and leave it type behaviors can be taught without using punishment. You would heavily reinforce the behavior of leaving the food (what you want), and slowly build up the time the food it left (starting with only one second to set the dog up for success). You would manage and interrupt unwanted behavior (trying to snatch food) with another cue or a management technique. I\'m sure the game works, but it has that potential fallout of frustration and confusion, and feeling like the dog has no control like punishment always does. it\'s not severe punishment, and I\'m not accusing anyone of being abusive or really unfair, but it\'s unnecessary (in my opinion) punishment and triggers unnecessary negative emotions.

He is a large boxer and I can’t have him running and jumping on any of his targets. I dare not let him off leash. He has also started lunging at dogs as we pass, even if I place myself between, it is frustrating, exhausting and no fun. Walks are dreaded. When he redlines he also becomes reactive to noise.

The behavior that I want is for him to lie down in his crate, let me open the door, clip the leash on the collar, stand up, and then release him. He could do this before he became a teenage maniac!. However, there is an extenuating circumstance. We are in the middle of getting a medical diagnosis of his incontinence problem. If we make it take too long for him to come out of the crate, he will pee in there. So I feel we have a conflict; either we work on pre-Mac to let him come out of the crate and then go outside to pee and to have fun after that, or and this is what my husband does, open the crate door, lasso the puppy with a slip lead, and rush outside before he peas on the floor. I see this as to mutually exclusive behaviors; we either prioritize getting him out of the crate and out of the house before he pees or we work on having him lie in the crate and let us get that leash on. At this point, since getting the Leeshan can be a safety situation, I would be willing to let him Pee in the crate while we are putting on the leash. But my husband wants to avoid peeing in the crate at all cost. Recently our puppy has been trying to leap out of the crate that is in the car as soon as the crate door opens. He refuses to maintain the down until the door is open. This is a dangerous situation if he were to get loose and run into the street. I am open to any suggestions!

I have a friend with a new puppy and my 15-month-old old rescue English Shepherd didn’t do well with the puppy the first time they met. I’m not sure if she just isn’t good with puppies or if she was feeling territorial (we had them meet in our backyard) or if she just got super frustrated that we wouldn’t let her meet the puppy without the fence being between them. There was a lot of loud barking and rushing the fence at the end. Initially she could be distracted, play ball, etc., but we decided to go ahead and take her inside when she started rushing the fence. This video has given me some ideas about how to proceed when my friend’s puppy is a bit older and more confident. Also, I wonder if Project Togetherness might be altered to work with my pup and my 6-year-old cat. My cat has grown up with dogs but has never experienced a large older puppy before and she is a bit nervous about all that puppy energy in such a large package (understandably). My pup, Abby, initially had barking fits every time she saw my cat. We’ve got a baby gate up so each can have their own space and everyone is safe. Abby doesn’t bark nearly as much after 6 weeks of living with us and our cat, but she still will growl through the gait if she sees the cat and lets out an occasional bark. The growl seems more like Abby trying to talk without barking than actual lip curling and aggression. I guess I’m wondering if I just need to continue with the current setup and rewarding Abby every time she sees the cat and doesn’t bark, or if there’s something else I can do to help Abby be calm and quiet and, ideally, not even interested in the cat, so my cat can enjoy the rest of the house again.', 'My 14+ dog is losing her hearing and eyesight.

It occurs off or on leash). He’s not aggressive. He’ll hit our legs with his nose, or may nip, or when real excited will grab our clothes (pants or shirt). Sometimes his behavior just shows it’s time for a nap, but other times he just does it. If I have a stuffed toy in my hand,  I give it to him to grab before he has a chance to herd. He also plays with moving toys (eg “Giggle ball”) that he can use for a herding outlet. I understand that he is teething, which aggravates his inclination to grab stuff. I would like some pointers on how to guide him so that his behavior is more appropriate for living with people.

Plus, with a muzzle, she isn’t able to trap the ball. \nSo, we’d walk several  steps, toss the ball for a break, let her play, then tell her “give” “leave it “, walk away from the ball & get back to work. At various times, she would immediately get the ball back, other times , she would work longer before getting the ball.  \nAt one point, we had her in a kennel with the ball & brought outside the dog that she previously attacked. She paid no mind to the dog working in front of her kennel. \nI was told this dog is not human aggressive, however, i firmly believe she would be so Over threshold with the ball that she wouldn’t make the distinction between the ball or human.\nWill you please share some other “games” we can use with her to build relationships. Unfortunately, with rescues being so overcrowded, lack of fosters, and more pups looking for homes, I feel the organization wants quicker results even though I’ve repeatedly stated she’s not a one and done, this is a process and training is ongoing. \n\nAt the end of our session, we were sitting with the ball on our lap, she was laying down in a relaxed position in front of us.', ""My dog's are only bad with their bone treats...

The owner then validates her with the buttons and sometimes she\'s still agitated and wants the owner to ""go check"". Often times we tell our dogs to be quiet when they alert us to outside noises when they are just trying to do their job. I\'ve found out that going to the door and pretending to listen or waiting for the noise, THEN telling it it\'s okay it\'s just the neighbors etc. works much better to calm the dog now.

One morning he entered the kennel and immediately knew something must have happened. Two of the dogs behaved not normal. Their body language was very submissive, they avoided eye contact and withdrew to a corner of the kennel. The man eventually found a new dug hole in the ground.

It took me longer to get up the stairs and have to admit I did yell.  Never touched him.  Said fine, that's where you can eat the rest of your breakfast - off the floor, no dish.  Not only did he never do it again, have to brag that a whole bag of treats fell off the fridge while we were out of the house one time years later.  The bag was never touched when we got home, the bag was still sitting where it fell.  Such a smart boy - what a good decision!  Not sure even my picky Dobe would've let that one alone.  I know we'd have remnants with my Beagle/JRT mix.  The older Dobe might sniff, but I will say, just because you can reach it, doesn't mean it's yours.  My chow hound, the Beagle/JRT mix, recently got about 4 pieces of liverwurst off the counter.  Again, my bad.  Get used to the dog that's normally in the kitchen not doing anything and you forget about the dogs passing through the kitchen to get to the living room.  Now, I throw a lick mat in her hot zone while I get the younger Dobe back in the house.

Criteria = expectations, More criteria = more consistency, more criteria = more work it is for you to maintain that criteria. What does criteria mean to your dog? Criteria is defined by what brings my dog joy. Four defining elements W - worth the dog's while, A - Achievable - what you're expecting/asking of your dog is something they are capable of doing. C - your expectations need to be Clear and C - Consistent. Clarity is kind. I would also argue that consistency is kind too because you are expecting your dog to conform, and if you aren't consistent, then it's surprising your dog, and sometimes in unpleasant ways (because they do not know what is expected of them). When you bring expectation for a new behaviour that has no history for consistency and they begin to offer new behaviours, this is not unpleasant because you are teaching through a game, and them trying different things is how they are attempting to work out what you're looking for. These surprises are fun because of how they are presented.

Training a dog is a great opportunity to learn through experience. Perfectionism is just another form of procrastination. Procrastination is a form of self protection.

(other games for connectedness: search, tug, recallers games) Next we create clarity for what we want, divide what you want into smaller behaviours like a computer programming problem - take small pieces and work towards clarity for that small portion - one part of a recall for example is the collar grab game. Next we check the dog\'s confidence - look at the TEMP of the dog (body language) for the dog to say ""I got this!"" and wanting more, next to last, challenge comes in three forms: distance, duration and distractions. do not work on all three at the same time, build up in small increments ping pong back and forth between one challenge at a time and your dog\'s confidence.

(I have listened to two of your podcasts today).  Our 16 week old puppy (blackmouth cur) needs lots of training!  Our biggest problem is that she is not food or treat oriented at all!

And that goes for any of the attempted training that we have tried.  I put her breakfast out this morning at 7:15, and she finally got around to eating it at 9:45.
