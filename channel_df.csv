However, I break the training up into small achievable steps so training should be fun and easy for both you and your dog giving you the skills needed to train your dog like a professional trainer.
 
Topics vary from: basic to advanced dog training, puppy training, obedience, dog tricks, behavior modification, stopping unwanted behavior, reactivity, fear, aggression, anxiety and over-arousal.

When not making Youtube videos Emily spends her time teaching other dog trainers as well as speaking at dog training conferences and seminars all over the world on the concept of training dogs without the use of physical or psychological intimidation.",41563688,358000,595,UU-qnqaajTk6bfs3UZuue6IQ
